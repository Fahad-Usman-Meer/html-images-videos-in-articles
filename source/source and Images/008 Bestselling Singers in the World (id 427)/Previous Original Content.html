<h2>#10 Taylor Swift</h2>
<p>Taylor Swift got her start in music early, becoming a professionally signed artist aged just 14. Her songs about personal life were highly endearing but they also created a lot of media gossip, contributing to her popularity.</p>
<p>She started topping with Billboard Hot Country Songs charts before ultimately bridging over to the pop charts. Since her debut, she has won countless awards including multiple Grammys.</p>
<p>Moreover, she was named Women of the Decade and Artist of the Decade. Taylor Swift has been one of the highest-grossing artists. While her popularity has slightly decreased as she tried breaking into Hollywood and started speaking about politics, but it doesn't take away from her unbelievable history in the music industry, which she has been focusing on again.</p>
<p>For the longest time, Swift was the sole songwriter for most of her material. However, her former record label Big Machine was purchased some time back (even including the masters for her first six albums). Taylor has been very open about her displeasure with this, saying she has been blocked from performing her own music.</p>
<h2>#9 Eminem</h2>
<p>Eminem's initial role as an entertaining shock rapper didn't take long to fade away as people started realizing they were witnessing greatness... they were witnessing the evolution of one of the all-time great rappers here.</p>
<p>His controversies and beefs with artists as well as connections with some of the best hip-hop producers in the industry led to massive sales as he was able to maintain a steady release schedule.</p>
<p>Eventually, he started releasing and starring in movies. He even launched his own record label named 'Shady Records', and won 15 Grammy Awards in his career.</p>
<p>No one can deny the raw entertainment value and technical ability in Eminem's music, which is the true explanation of how he was able to launch himself up in the list fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Did you know, Eminem or also known as Marshall Mathers, became the first rapper to receive an Academy Award for Best Original song, which featured in his movie 8 Mile. Eminem was once sued by his own mom for slander. Bullies who beat him during his time at elementary school sued him for exposing the story in rhyme form.</p>
<h2>#8 Pink Floyd</h2>
<p>Pink Floyd had a really strong start as their first album came out in 1967. Earlier they were led by Syn Barrett but it was only after the inclusion of David Gilmour that they really exploded and became international sensations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they had only two singles to enter the top 10 of the US or UK charts, though they had four albums that topped both charts.</p>
<p>Pink Floyd have had a six-decade run, a lot of time to establish themselves as one of the best bands of all time with their 15 released albums. To top it all off, they've even composed a few scores of films. Two of their albums 'The Wall' and 'The Dark Side of the Moon' are among some of the bestselling albums of all time.</p>
<p>Pink Floyd were massive fans of Monty Python and even put up a great chunk of money needed for financing the 1975 movie 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. The band name actually comes from two of Barrett's favorite blues players – Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.</p>
<h2>#7 Rihanna</h2>
<p>Rihanna is renowned for her artistic evolution, having started with Caribbean-influenced music and moving into dance-pop, EDM, R&B, and hip-hop. It might come as a surprise as it happened steadily over time but the iconic singer has produced 14 number-one singles, 31 top-ten singles, 9 Grammy Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, 13 American Music Awards, and more.</p>
<p>Rihanna has been on a long hiatus, growing her cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty and her fashion house. These created more pent-up demand and excitement for her 9th studio album. Rihanna has also bridged into Hollywood and TV roles, starring in a few major box office hits.</p>
<p>Did you know, Rihanna sometimes uses her surname 'Fenty' to represent all her non-music businesses? She once sued her own dad to try and stop him from using the 'Fenty Entertainment' brand name, saying that he is misleading the public and trying to assert association with the brand.</p>
<h2>#6 Led Zeppelin</h2>
<p>While Led Zeppelin worked in the folk-rock and blues-rock genres, they are widely considered to be the progenitors of heavy metal. This is a clear indication of the massive appeal they have.</p>
<p>Their legendary single 'Stairway to Heaven' still remains one of the most influential and most popular songs in rock history.</p>
<p>The Led Zeppelin tours broke attendance records while their albums were always among the bestselling albums. In fact, all of their nine albums have broken into the top 10 while six of them have peaked at the #1 spot.</p>
<p>Led Zeppelin made music at a time the internet didn't exist. It has been almost 40 years since they recorded their last album. The internet has made it easier for people to realize how many of their songs have been plagiarized, if not heavily influenced by.</p>
<h2>#5 Madonna</h2>
<p>Madonna has been pushing pop hits up the Billboard charts for decades, with each one fueling her rise even more. She is one of those artists who have managed to constantly reinvent themselves and stay relevant and exciting. Maybe more important than any music she produces is her constant touring, which helps her in marketing further.</p>
<p>Business activities have helped Madonna promote her music. Moreover, she is a Golden Globe-winning actress and the owner of Maverick Records while she has also authorized a few children's books. In music, attention is a massive accuracy and Madonna certainly knows how to get it.</p>
<p>Madonna is the highest-grossing solo female artist of all time. Moreover, she is also the most-touring female musician and the best-selling female recording artist of all time.</p>
<h2>#4 Elton John</h2>
<p>Elton John is a supremely talented songwriter, entertainer, and performer. His flamboyant style is magnetic, which has led to many successes in his career.</p>
<p>He currently holds the record for the bestselling single of all time in the USA and the UK. He is constantly touring and winning awards but even his work in movies like 'The Lion King' and the biopic on his life 'Rocketman' have continued to fuel his sales.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of his career was his long residency at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. This made him some serious cash.</p>
<p>Billboard ranks him as one of the most successful male solo artists of all time. He has also released 30 studio albums, let alone his greatest hits, collaborations, and soundtracks.</p>
<p>The middle name of Sir Elton John is 'Hercules'. He was originally born as 'Reginald Kenneth Dwight' and was knighted in 1998 for services to music and charitable services. He has also performed at a number of royal events at Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.</p>
<h2>#3 Michael Jackson</h2>
<p>The King of Pop doesn't need an introduction, does he?</p>
<p>Michael Jackson is easily the greatest entertainer of all time and certainly one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. From his early days in the Jackson 5 to his solo career, Michael Jackson spent his whole life making some of the best music the industry has ever heard, leading to him becoming one of the most-watched musicians of all time.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' remains the second bestselling album of all time. Before his run ended, his wealth was so enormous that he owned The Beatles catalog, was accused of everything, and sued constantly, while his concerts were spectacles that musicians have since ever been able to replicate.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson's estate would bring him around $825 million every year, the highest amount for a musician. Once he won 8 Grammy Awards in one ceremony, which is tied for the record with 'Santana'. During his 'Thriller' years, he had the highest royalty rate in the industry at $2 per sale.</p>
<h2>#2 Elvis Presley</h2>
<p>Elvis Presley is very similar to Michael Jackson in a lot of ways. He was widely called the King of Rock & Roll and considered to be one of the most important cultural icons of the 20th century. His overall output has been monumental, including 17 soundtracks, 24 studio albums, and starring in 33 Hollywood flicks in 25 years.</p>
<p>Presley still holds the record for the most songs to chart in Billboard Top 40 (115 songs) and Top 100s (152 songs). He has had 25 multi-platinum records and 101 gold albums, which is an all-time record. The upper bound of his sales estimates reach as much as 1 billion.</p>
<p>Presley was drafted into military service in 1958, the height of his career. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 2018. His house, Graceland, has become the 2nd most visited house in the US after the White House. Moreover, it has been a National Historic Landmark since 2006. In fact, he even has a spider named after him – the Paradonea Presleyi.</p>
<h2>#1 The Beatles</h2>
<p>Even though The Beatles might have only been active as a band from 1960 to 1970, they still hold the clear lead as the #1 bestselling artist of all time. In fact, if you add their solo material, no one can ever dream of beating them.</p>
<p>A massive part of their success was leading the 'British Invasion' of British pop and rock in the US. Their art largely evolved with each release, as did their controversies.</p>
<p>They have won all the awards there are to win, starred in many films, broke several records, and one of their songs has become the most covered ever.</p>
<p>The Lennon-McCartney duo will likely never be topped. Beyond their pop appeal, they were some of the best and most talented musicians to ever walk the earth.</p>
