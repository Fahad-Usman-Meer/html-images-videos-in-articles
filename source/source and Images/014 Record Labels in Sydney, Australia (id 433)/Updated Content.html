<p><p>One of the most common questions that many musicians have is how to send a demo to a record label. Instead of struggling to come up with the right way to approach a record label on YouTube and other music resources, in this article, you will get to know a summarized form of how you should approach a record label. Pitching in your demo this way will help you have a better chance of getting signed up.</p>
<p><p>Here are seven steps that you must keep in mind before you approach a record label hoping to land your first record deal.</p>
<h3>Write a great bio that impresses the label</h3>
<p>First things first – you should make sure that you, as an artist or band, are properly and professionally represented online. You should come up with a compelling bio that gets the reader excited about you and makes them want to know more about your story.</p>

<p>Moreover, check the consistency of your social media name, social media presence, the look of your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and SoundCloud pages. Moreover, you should constantly be pushing out fresh content because you wouldn't want to present yourself as an inactive project.</p>

<h3>Prepare a catalog of your tunes</h3>
<p>Remember, it is all about producing and recording quality material. This is one of the first things that most record labels notice when listening to demos from aspiring artists.</p>

<p>You need to make sure that your music is release-ready before you send it to the record label. Never compromise on the quality because even though record labels are always buried with new demos, they find it very easy to notice a lack of quality in the demos.</p>

Most of the demos today are built on bought templates, construction kits, sample CDs, and Sylenth presets, which is not enough. Moreover, the majority of tracks are badly mixed, over-compressed to sound loud, have no clean frequencies, and produced without passion. Many people even sell stolen tracks or tracks produced by ghost producers.</p>

<p>If you do anything like this, there is no way your demo will be accepted even if you send it to 50 different record labels.</p>

<p>This should give you a better idea of what to watch out for in terms of quality. Try to put your heart and soul into the demo instead of producing something that is trendy in today's music. Nobody gets rich after just one release in digital stores. You will not be rich if you're able to have one hit song chart in the Beatport charts. It is all about the depth of your music, your potential, and your overall capability as an artist.</p>

<h3>Do ample research</h3>
<p>Know who you need to reach out to. It is recommended that you should create a spreadsheet first with the names of the record labels you want to target, their contact details, your approach to impressing them, and links to demo submission requirements.</p>

<p>Music blogs and record labels also have specific guidelines on how to submit and how not to submit your music.</p>

<p>So what is the right way to contact services you've shortlisted in your spreadsheet? The answer is pretty simple. Whether you're contacting record labels, music blogs, magazines, radio shows, music distribution services, or promotional services, you will need to check their specific submission guidelines before you get in touch with them. This is one of the most fundamental rules of promotion. It was the rule before, it is the rule now, and it will be the rule several years in the future when humans have giant heads and robotic bodies.</p>

<p>Moreover, you shouldn't be pitching in your request by merely sending a generic email, writing with bad grammar and spelling mistakes, sending unsolicited material, and so on.</p>

<p>You should properly prepare for your approach. You need to know the style of music the services you're contacting actually want to receive and promote.</p>

<h3>Provide relevant information</h3>
<p>If you want to get your demo heard by a record label, one of the most important pieces of advice that apply universally is that you should only be sending requests to record labels that might be interested in your style of music. It won't make sense if you spam emails to record labels who make pop music and you're sending them demos of jazz tracks hoping they notice you and give you your big break.</p>

<p>Don't send your demos to every record label you can find. You need to be focused and spend time learning a record label's catalog before crafting a personal, resonating pitch that you feel will help you get accepted by them.</p>

<p>Moreover, producing a great track will just be the first step on your road to success. Sure, you could easily release it yourself but if you are aiming to reach the biggest possible audience, then linking up with established record labels should still be your best bet.</p>

<p>Proper research and appropriateness are very important because one of the biggest no-nos for record labels is receiving an MP3 file attached to a badly written email. Such emails just clog up the inbox and crash the email program. If you're sending a demo to a record label, try sending it via SoundCloud stream as it is much more preferable and could be checked quickly and even downloaded if the record label likes your track.</p>

<p>You must remember to send the right type of music to the right contact. Record labels usually receive a lot of music on a daily basis, so if you're relevant to them, you'll still need to present yourself in a genuinely unique and creative way in order to stand out.</p>

<p>Being creative about how you are present yourself is key. The more you appear to be a fully-formed artist, the more likely it will be that the record label takes you seriously.</p>

<h3>Think like a record label</h3>
<p>If you want to get accepted by a record label, you will have to pitch in with an impressive demo. In order to pitch in with an impressive demo, you'll need to think like a record label.</p>

<p>You need to understand how a record label thinks and what they perceive to be acceptable and what they perceive to be unacceptable.</p>

<p>Your email pitch, your demo sample, the tool you use to share the audio files, in fact, everything will need to be on point if you want to get accepted. For instance, always look to share your audio files through SoundCloud, Dropbox, or any streaming app. No one really likes to download an attached MP3 file only to find out an unimpressive track.</p>

<p>Moreover, you should value the opinion of others, so try to get feedback from an expert to make sure you send a polished track to the label. Also, make sure you avoid taking opinions from friends or relatives. You don't need feedback from yeah-sayers who will want to motivate you and compliment you no matter what. You don't need that. You require hard criticism and honest opinion about your music.</p>

<p>Record labels are primarily a business and businesses need revenue to survive. Every record label is looking for a hit. While they don't necessarily want every track to be a mainstream hit, but even tracks that are good enough to catch the attention of the audience are adequate.</p>

<p>However, with the distribution options and ease of access to music in today's digital age, record labels are dependent on the marketing power of artists themselves.</p>

<p>So record labels will prefer artists that already have a loyal fanbase and artists who are capable of branding, marketing, and promoting themselves without necessarily needed the help of the label itself.</p>

<p>For instance, Deadmau5's record label Mau5trap stated that they will no longer be signing musicians who aren't totally self-sufficient, regardless of their musical quality.</p>

<h3>Send it out</h3>
<p>Now comes the time to send your demo to the record label. You should start small and pitch to limited record labels at a time. Moreover, you shouldn't be upset in case you don't hear anything back immediately. Always look to improve yourself, so if you get rejected for a track, try to come back with another improved track later.</p>

<p>Moreover, you should follow up with every contact a week or two after the original approach. Remember that a rejection is good as well and it is much better than not getting a response at all. Like mentioned earlier, keep a spreadsheet and keep a column to track if you've got a response or not.</p>

<h3>Submit a demo to both independent and famed record labels</h3>
<p>If you're looking to get signed to a record label, you should look to submit demos to both independent and famed record labels. Also, look for a label that makes music in your genre. Make your pitch via email and examine all the options and sign the best deal possible for your career.</p>
