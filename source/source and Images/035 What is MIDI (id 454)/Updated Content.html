<h2 id="what-is-midi">What is MIDI?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-what-is-midi.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="What is MIDI?" alt="What is MIDI?"></p>

<p>MIDI is the communication standard that’ll allow digital music gear to speak the same language. It is the short form for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is the protocol that’ll allow musical instruments, computers, and other hardware to communicate.</p>
<p>MIDI was developed first in the early 80s to standardize the growing amount of digital music hardware. In the early days, manufacturers were looking for a simple way of making their products compatible with the ones of other brands.</p>
<p>Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi gave the idea of a standard instrument language to the other major manufacturers, including Moog, Sequential Circuits, and Oberheim, in 1981.</p>
<p>The project had many lofty goals. MIDI attempted to provide ways to communicate all of the features of a musical performance digitally. The MIDI standard’s architects had to define different kinds of complex musical behavior in a way 1980s era technology could work with – which isn’t an easy task.</p>
<p>The choices had huge implications for the way electronic instruments would go on to be designed for the next 40 years. The finished MIDI was finally unveiled in 1982. Kakehashi and Dave Smith later received Technical Grammy Awards in 2013 for playing a key role in the development of MIDI.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-midi">A brief history of MIDI</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-a-brief-history-of-midi.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="A brief history of MIDI" alt="A brief history of MIDI"></p>

<p>MIDI was invented in the early 80s. Since there were no standardized means to synchronize musical instruments and trying to get instruments to communicate with each other was like a Japanese speaker and an English speaker in a room, so companies came together to introduce the concept of MIDI.</p>
<p>Communication was very essential when creating music with multiple instruments. After all, you wouldn’t want to be limited to just the products of one company.</p>
<p>A meeting between Ikutaro Kakehashi (the Roland founder), Tom Oberheim, (Oberheim Electronics founder), and Dave Smith (Sequential Circuits president) in the early 80s started the discussion with representatives from Yamaha, Kawai, and Korg that a universal language needs to be created such that different instruments are able to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>A unique idea of this musical standard was proposed in November 1981 at the Audio Engineering Show. Eventually, this would lead to Robert Moog announcing the concept of MIDI in October 1982, which was demonstrated in 1983, with signals getting transmitted between a Roland JP-6 and Sequential Circuits Prophet 600.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-midi-in-music">How to use MIDI in music?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-how-to-use-midi-in-music.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How to use MIDI in music?" alt="How to use MIDI in music?"></p>

<p>MIDI can easily play different roles in your music production. You might be familiar with some of them already. To get started, it would be more helpful if you clear up what MIDI is not.</p>
<p>MIDI does not transmit an actual audio signal, it is only information. This means that if a MIDI keyboard does not have an onboard sound source, say a sampler or synth, it won’t make any sound.</p>
<p>This sheds light on where MIDI can come into the workflow.</p>
<p>If you are composing music using plugins in your DAW, MIDI clips would be the regions on your timeline that control which notes the plugins play and when they are played.</p>
<p>When you’re connecting a MIDI controller to the DAW for playing virtual instruments, you’ll simply feed them real-time MIDI information. The same will be true when you’re sequencing MIDI in your DAW and send the info to the hardware gear like a drum machine or analog synth.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of using MIDI would be that you can easily edit performance note by note, alter or replace the sound, change their articulation, and more.</p>
<p>But that isn’t all! You can easily control a lot more than merely notes using MIDI. Numerous features of a traditional musical performance will have an equivalent in MIDI. You could use it to automate parameters or change patches on software or hardware instruments or effects. This is where MIDI messages come in to make the difference.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/CZ4ybhg2UZY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="midi-messages-and-midi-events">MIDI messages and MIDI events</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-midi-messages-and-midi-events.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MIDI messages and MIDI events" alt="MIDI messages and MIDI events"></p>

<p>In short, MIDI messages are the digital data transmissions that’ll tell your music gear what to do. These will carry information about which parameters need to be changed, how the system will behave, or which notes should be played, and how they should be played.</p>
<p>MIDI messages are of two different types – System messages and Channel messages.</p>
<p>There are times when you will be dealing with channel messages, even though some important functions like transport and clock are system messages.</p>
<p>Starting with channel messages – Channel messages transmit up to two types of data at once.</p>
<p>For example, note on and off messages can carry the note number value and the velocity value, the intensity at which the note is played.</p>
<p>This is part of how MIDI is able to capture the expressiveness of a performance.</p>
<p>Here are the primary MIDI channel messages –</p>
<ul>
    <li>Control change: Changes the parameter value of the device</li>
    <li>Aftertouch: The pressure at which a key is held down after it is depressed</li>
    <li>Note ON and OFF: Which notes are released and depressed, also includes velocity</li>
    <li>Channel change: The greatest pressure value for all depressed keys</li>
    <li>Program change: Will change the patch number on the device</li>
    <li>Pitch bend change: It is the change in the pitch bend wheel or lever</li>
</ul>
<p>System messages will control other essential data that digital instruments will need to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Here are the primary MIDI system messages –</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transport: It tells the device to continue, start, or stop</li>
    <li>Timing clock: It’ll synchronize the device with the master clock</li>
    <li>System exclusive (sysex): The sysex messages will allow manufacturers to specify different types of messages. Some older MIDI gear exclusively rely on sysex</li>
</ul>
<p>This might seem complicated but for most MIDI tasks the DAW handles the technical details of the MIDI messages without you even knowing. A MIDI event would be a MIDI message that occurs at a specific time. These messages are especially relevant when it comes to compositions that heavily rely on MIDI sequencers.</p>

<h2 id="midi-sequencers">MIDI sequencers</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-midi-sequencers.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MIDI sequencers" alt="MIDI sequencers"></p>

<p>A MIDI sequencer will store MIDI information and manages playback, editing, and recording. It is a fairly common way of using MIDI. In this configuration, the sequencer will send the data to all of the different parts of your setup while keeping them in-sync with each other.</p>
<p>For the majority of music producers, their DAW will take care of MIDI sequencer duties.</p>
<p>DAWs and sequencers are very closely related. In fact, Cubase started out as a MIDI sequencer</p>.
<p>Many musicians prefer using hardware sequencers for their unique capabilities or workflow.</p>
<p>Numerous synths contain onboard sequencers while grooveboxes like the Akai MPC are popular for their sequencing capabilities. Sequencers can control virtual instruments, external hardware in the DAW, or even a combination of both.</p>

<h2 id="midi-channels">MIDI channels</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-midi-channels.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MIDI channels" alt="MIDI channels"></p>

<p>MIDI was introduced to coordinate musical gestures between different instruments at the same time with just a single connection. One stream of MIDI data will feature a total of 16 independent channels for events and messages.</p>
<p>You could think of these channels in your DAW or sequencer, but avoid getting confused, you are certainly not limited to just 16 MIDI tracks in the DAW.</p>
<p>MIDI channels are very important when dealing with external hardware. Each device in the MIDI setup can be set to send/receive data on a particular channel.</p>
<p>From there, it will be as easy as setting the output channel on tracks in the sequencer to determine which device will play what. Moreover, it also means that you can chain all the devices together easily with a single cable using the MIDI interface.</p>

<h2 id="midi-interfaces-and-controllers">MIDI interfaces and controllers</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-midi-interfaces-and-controllers.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MIDI interfaces and controllers" alt="MIDI interfaces and controllers"></p>

<p>A MIDI interface is a device that lets you send MIDI information in and out of the computer over USB. They’ll be perfect for working with external MIDI gear such as hardware synths and drum machines. Some of them even have multiple pairs of MIDI I/O for accommodating every possible device in your studio.</p>
<p>In fact, MIDI controllers are a type of MIDI interface having an input device built-in. Typical input methods that are available on MIDI controllers are pressure-sensitive pads and piano keys, but most include sliders and knobs for controlling other parameters as well.</p>

<h2 id="midi-cables">MIDI cables</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-midi-cables.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MIDI cables" alt="MIDI cables"></p>

<p>MIDI will require special cables for connecting with the digital music gear. You might have seen these circular cables with an odd number of pins before. These 5-pin DIN cables are used for connecting the inputs, outputs, thru outputs on traditional MIDI gear.</p>
<p>Some extra compact gear makes use of MIDI over ¼” or 1/8” balanced TRS cable. In such situations, you might have to use special cables or converter boxes to interface with devices that are using the 5-pin connector.</p>
<p>MIDI interfaces (and a few forward-looking MIDI synths) connect to computers using a USB interface.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/xs62GSaP51A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="midi-in-midi-out-and-midi-thru">MIDI In, MIDI Out, and MIDI Thru</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-midi-in-midi-out-and-midi-thru.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MIDI In, MIDI Out, and MIDI Thru" alt="MIDI In, MIDI Out, and MIDI Thru"></p>

<p>Information will flow in one direction per MIDI connection. This is why you need to set up three MIDI ports on the back of MIDI-outfitted gears.</p>
<p>The most commonly used configuration is three ports with MIDI In, MIDI Out, and MIDI Thru. The correct way of connecting them might be a bit confusing, depending on the situation. To get things right, you’ll need to follow the direction of the signal flow.</p>
<p>MIDI Thru will be used for sending the same MIDI information to multiple devices. You need to remember that you can set each device to a different channel while using a single stream of MIDI to control them.</p>
<p>MIDI Thru is how you will be making the connection. You just need to connect the MIDI Thru of the first device to the next device’s MIDI In to duplicate the MIDI data and send it downstream.</p>

<h2 id="common-midi-setups">Common MIDI Setups</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/454-common-midi-setups.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Common MIDI Setups" alt="Common MIDI Setups"></p>

<p>There are many ways to use MIDI but some of them are preferred more than others. There are a few typical MIDI workflows that most producers should know –</p>
<h3>DAW and MIDI controller</h3>
<p>Arguably the simplest and most common MIDI setup involves using a MIDI controller with a DAW in your home studio.</p>

<p>It is a simple and extremely powerful way of using MIDI.</p>

<p>Taking the help of VST plugins, this setup will turn your MIDI controller into what you want it to be. Millions of different guitars, synths, flutes, drum machines, horns, or anything else that you can dream of.</p>

<p>You could edit sequences in the piano roll and input notes manually with the help of the controller to play different parts.</p>

<p>Moreover, the MIDI controllers also come with pads, knobs, and sliders that are assigned through the DAW.</p>

<p>This setup is fairly light and intuitive to compose all genres of music via MIDI.</p>

<h3>Computer, MIDI interface, and synthesizers</h3>
<p>With the MIDI interface handling conversion duties, the MIDI tracks in the DAW sequencer can easily control actual hardware synthesizers.</p>

<p>This means that you’ll be able to use all our digital tools and techniques to input, edit notes, and play them with a real synthesizer or any MIDI-capable device.</p>

<p>In such situations, your DAW will act as the main hub for sending and sequencing all the MIDI info. If you use the DAW piano roll, you’ll be able to instruct each hardware unit to play any sequence of notes on MIDI channels.</p>

<h3>Hardware sequencer, drum machine, and synthesizer</h3>
<p>Not every MIDI setup has to be computer-centric.</p>

<p>In this example, a hardware sequencer will take the place of your DAW’s MIDI editing features. By making use of MIDI Thru, the sequencer will be able to send info to three devices – two synths and a drum machine.</p>
