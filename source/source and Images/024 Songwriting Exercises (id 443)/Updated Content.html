<p>The art of songwriting requires utmost self-consciousness. For the exercises to work out successfully, the songwriter needs to understand themselves to maintain the atmosphere that initially sparked their interest and capabilities in the art.</p>

<h2 id="have-a-designated-songwriting-book">Have a Designated Songwriting Book</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-have-a-designated-songwriting-book.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Have a Designated Songwriting Book" alt="Have a Designated Songwriting Book"></p>

<p>Never assume that you will remember random creative ideas or lyrics that cross your mind as you go about your day. Always carry along a designated book that you can scribble down quick thoughts to help you when you settle down to start songwriting.</p>

<p>You can write about anything and everything. Don't ignore those little thoughts you consider irrelevant; they may match up with something else you encounter. Let the book you have for lyrics be as close to you as your shadow. You may get a new line for that song you have meant to complete for so long!</p>

<h2 id="use-a-song-title-generator">Use a Song Title Generator</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-use-a-song-title-generator.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Use a Song Title Generator" alt="Use a Song Title Generator"></p>

<p>There are many song title generators you can use online. However, it is not cast on a stone that you have to use the suggestion provided for you. Some of these apps are just useful in activating your creative mind to produce something.</p>
<p>Song title generators can also provide random titles to write about. I know songwriters that have utilized these generators and derived hit song titles by combining different suggestions brought up in the search. These title generators will help you maintain originality. However, please don't be overly dependent on them because you never know how many more songwriters use them to get the same suggestions.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/OmbvqexdTYU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="expose-yourself-to-different-media">Expose Yourself to Different Media</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-expose-yourself-to-different-media.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Expose Yourself to Different Media" alt="Expose Yourself to Different Media"></p>

<p>Exposure is always important for drawing inspiration. You can't compare a songwriter that is always environmental-conscious to one that is ever locked up. Please note that I have nothing against introverts. However, you have to get out of the box to produce an out-of-the-box masterpiece.</p>
<p>Make use of all your senses. Look at images, try new foods, visit new places, use new products, whatever it takes to shift you out of what you are used to. Don't leave anything to chance because experience goes a long way in influencing creativity. Get out of your comfort zone and watch even those movie genres you have never considered. Who knows, it might be carrying your new line of expression.</p>

<h2 id="experiment-with-different-themes">Experiment with Different Themes</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-experiment-with-different-themes.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Experiment with Different Themes" alt="Experiment with Different Themes"></p>

<p>Do your research and identify various topics that songs are about. For example, you can identify themes of love, heartbreak, hatred, anger, or bitterness to write about. The themes you select can be categorized, so you have a variety to choose from. You can choose a theme based on emotions, a sport, food, a drink, or even a place.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the themes, set deadlines to sharpen your creativity and time management skills; as time goes by, you will gain momentum, and songwriting will become more enjoyable. It also prepares you for bigger future gigs with a lot of pressure to deliver quality work in short timeframes.</p>

<h2 id="maximize-on-your-personality">Maximize on Your Personality</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-maximize-on-your-personality.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Maximize on Your Personality" alt="Maximize on Your Personality"></p>

<p>Take time to understand who you are and what you like so you know what to work with and how to work around it. For example, if you are an introvert, find introverted strategies to maximize your strength. Some introverted songwriters activate their creative minds during their alone time.</p>
<p>Other songwriters come up with new content best when they are around certain people. Try to make use of your personality in places that relate to your song's theme. For instance, if you are writing a song about food, you may consider visiting a food place to capture both your responses and those of others.</p>

<h2 id="narrow-down-to-your-emotions">Narrow Down to Your Emotions</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-narrow-down-to-your-emotions.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Narrow Down to Your Emotions" alt="Narrow Down to Your Emotions"></p>

<p>Never ignore how you feel about certain events in your life. Carry your personal diary and pen down how you feel in the heat of the moment. I know people that tend to be very expressive in writing amidst situations. Some hit songs are a result of heartbreaks or new-found love. This trend is especially popular with celebrities.</p>
<p>It is easy to discern some celebrities' phases of life by their latest release. I am not encouraging you to forget your humanness and get all weird writing and singing songs when you are sad; you aren't acting a musical. I am saying you should record your emotions and revisit them later when the moment dies down. You will be surprised at how you expressed yourself and get inspired by new lyrics.</p>

<h2 id="take-a-break-and-go-easy-on-yourself">Take a Break and Go Easy on Yourself</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-take-a-break-and-go-easy-on-yourself.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Take a Break and Go Easy on Yourself" alt="Take a Break and Go Easy on Yourself"></p>

<p>Every songwriter has their moment of blankness, although it is more frequent for beginners. You don't have to beat yourself over it. Many successful songwriters gave a common remedy. When they can't download any more creativity, they take a break and do something they love to distract them.</p>
<p>Have you had moments when you wanted to do something but couldn't remember exactly what it was? The same case applies here. You could have an understanding of the required theme, but your brain seems to zone out. Do something different, and that new idea will pop up when you least expect it.</p>

<h2 id="the-random-game">The Random Game</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-the-random-game.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="The Random Game" alt="The Random Game"></p>

<p>You can try out a quick challenge that will jumpstart your brain amidst all the fun it carries. Write down a list of words and have a friend shuffle them up. Let them pick up one card per minute and flip it while you randomly sing lyrics related to the theme in the card. It will train your brain to think as fast as your lips.</p>
<p>The closest thing to this challenge was once in a TV show called "Don't Forget the Lyrics," where random words would pop up on the screen, and the contestant had to switch and use the word somewhere in their composed lyrics. It was fun and raised the adrenaline rush in both the viewers and lyricists.</p>

<h2 id="the-journalist-behaviour">The Journalist Behaviour</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-the-journalist-behaviour.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="The Journalist Behaviour" alt="The Journalist Behaviour"></p>

<p>The common nature of journalists is observing and recording. This duo should become your new hobby. Learn to be conscious of everything that is happening around you. The more you record, the more you will remember, and the more inspiration you will get. Becoming a professional songwriter requires plenty of memory and observation.</p>
<p>Work with your long-term ambitions in mind. Consider the possibility of working for clientele that may require customized lyrics and allow the lives of other people to inspire you too. Most songwriters start with their personal lives as inspiration, but the more you grow, the more complicated your inspiration sources. Get out of that comfort zone.</p>

<h2 id="collaborate-with-another-songwriter">Collaborate with another Songwriter</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-collaborate-with-another-songwriter.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Collaborate with another Songwriter" alt="Collaborate with another Songwriter"></p>

<p>Two is better than one. You need to identify another songwriter with a similar vibe to yours and do a collabo with them some time. You should have someone to challenge you and share their mind with you. Many songwriters fear that another may steal their work. However, you can take time to socialize and build trustworthy relationships with at least one other songwriter.</p>
<p>The more the minds, the greater the diversity. Many hit songs are a result of collaborations between songwriters. You might be surprised at what becomes of two great minds combined to create one piece.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/7ASLygm1YM0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="break-the-routines-be-spontaneous">Break the Routines, Be Spontaneous!</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-break-the-routines-be-spontaneous.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Break the Routines Be Spontaneous" alt="Break the Routines Be Spontaneous"></p>

<p>To think out of the box, you have to break away from the confines of doing things the ordinary way. Old habits will only replicate your output and suppress your creativity. The first step to thinking outside the box is getting out of it! Give yourself a break from following the same old routines if you need something new.</p>
<p>This principle does not only apply to daily activities but also your writing styles. If you are used to doing the lyrics before the melody, try the other way around sometimes. First, finish the melody, then fill in the lyrics. A change is as good as a rest.</p>

<h2 id="learn-and-apply-new-skills">Learn and Apply New Skills</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-learn-and-apply-new-skills.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Learn and Apply New Skills" alt="Learn and Apply New Skills"></p>

<p>You never have enough knowledge, regardless of how learned you are. Even the best of graduates and songwriters go back to the books to pick out something new. Moreover, the world of music is a ground for constant discovery of new ways and trends. Therefore, do the necessary and learn more.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a successful songwriter with little or no background in music study, you have greater potential to expand. Consider doing a short or long course on music depending on your long-term goals and ambitions for songwriting as a career. Afterward, learn how to apply those new skills and techniques to make your skills more advanced.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/0eItWeZFVHo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="socialize">Socialize</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-socialize.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Socialize" alt="Socialize"></p>

<p>If you are a songwriter drawing inspiration from current affairs, you will need to socialize with people. How else will you know people's stories unless you talk to them? The beauty of socializing is that stories never end. I know of songwriters who wrote from the inspiration of other people's stories and got a go-ahead to use the storytellers' actual names.</p>
<p>A songwriter should realize that humans are social beings. We are meant to talk to each other and grow in knowledge. The more you socialize, the more your knowledge and variety. Most outgoing songwriters find it easy to compose spontaneous lyrics because they know a lot.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/7pZC02SDkD8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="talk-less-and-listen-more">Talk Less and Listen More</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-talk-less-and-listen-more.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Talk Less and Listen More" alt="Talk Less and Listen More"></p>

<p>It is wiser to take in more than you take out. There is a common phrase that says "garbage in, garbage out." Be conscious of your associations as they influence what comes from you. Spend time around contexts you want to write about. What flows out of your mind will be original and come out with ease. Can you imagine being in Beverly Hills trying to write about the ghetto? The disconnect is just too great.</p>
<p>Take time to listen to people more. As you grow as a songwriter, you will be required to write based on the client's story and not yours. You want to be sure you can pick something from others and make it more about them and less about you.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/O2M8zDTuhmk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="note-down-the-key-words-for-the-song">Note Down the Key Words for the Song</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-note-down-the-key-words-for-the-song.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Note Down the Key Words for the Song" alt="Note Down the Key Words for the Song"></p>

<p>A songwriter's mind can drift off to irrelevant subjects from the song's theme more often than not. If you experience this a lot, write down the keywords surrounding the song's theme and place them somewhere you can constantly refer to, somewhere like the wall right in front of your writing desk.</p>
<p>Every time you are brainstorming and begin to drift off, look at the words you wrote to retune your mind in the right direction. Keep doing this until you learn how to focus on one area at a time. Despite the thousands of thoughts running through our minds, a distracted songwriter can be very unproductive. Keep your head in the game and know when to separate work from personal life.</p>

<h2 id="defy-the-norm">Defy the Norm</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-defy-the-norm.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Defy the Norm" alt="Defy the Norm"></p>

<p>Music theory is fond of placing rules and principles governing the manipulation of elements to make music. Some of the best songwriters have emerged due to defying the principles and daring to create the "catastrophe" that became a new trend. What is the worst that could happen by trying something foreign to the world of music?</p>
<p>If it doesn't work out, change it and keep trying, and if it does, it was worth the rebelliousness. One Tom Waits created new songs by simultaneously turning on five radios. That sounds like a weird technique, but that's just the songwriter's life; everything about sound inspires music.</p>

<h2 id="try-existing-songs-with-new-melodies">Try Existing Songs with New Melodies</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/443-try-existing-songs-with-new-melodies.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Try Existing Songs with New Melodies" alt="Try Existing Songs with New Melodies"></p>

<p>Have you ever heard two versions of a song sounding like they are from two different genres? That is probably the work of a creative songwriter. Artists that do covers or parodies are popular for creating new melodies for hit songs. You can do it for training purposes. Select songs you are familiar with and try to fix their lyrics in modified melodies.</p>

<p>I have heard fast-tempo songs remade into slow-tempo ones before and vice versa. Cover song artists know how to modify both the tempo and melody. Experiment with existing songs and learn new tricks before you meet the real deal.</p>
