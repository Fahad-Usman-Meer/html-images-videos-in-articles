<p>If you're a musician who creates original music and you haven't signed your publishing rights away, you'll be your own publisher and you own the publishing rights. You will be owed publishing royalties for the usage of your composition.</p>
<p>The composition is the structural elements (lyrics and melody) that underlie any recording of the song. As you turn a finished track into a finished recording, a lot of things can change along the way. Production could play a massive role in the ultimate success of your track. Especially in the world of EDM and hip-hop, there can be a lot of blurred lines between 'producer' and 'songwriter'.</p>
<h2>How should songwriters split publishing royalties?</h2>

</p>
<p>If there are two or more people collaborating to write a song, the path is pretty clear and each person will have a share of the song and split credits and royalties accordingly.</p>
<h3>Record points vs. Songwriting points</h3>
<p>Instead of giving the producers songwriting points, the recording artists traditionally used to give their producers 2 to 4 points on the records.</p>
<p>In simple words, it means that they would give 2 to 4% of the total revenue generated from the sales of these records. For each $0.99 iTunes sale, around two to four cents would go to the producer.</p>
<p>However, the last few years have brought about a change. With record sales continuing to decline, many producers have started calling themselves songwriters. In a few cases, it is totally justified.</p>
<p>If the producer is indeed a co-writer, they'll be entitled to a portion of the songwriting copyright for the length of the copyright. Once a producer becomes a songwriter, they'll always be seen as the songwriter of that song. They'll also be entitled to revenue from radio play, usage on TV, playing at sports events, and any other time that song is played anywhere.</p>
<h3>What should the songwriter percentages be?</h3>
<p>There is no single answer to this question, however, there are a few common scenarios –</p>
<li>There are a few songwriters who work under an agreement where they'll split everything evenly, regardless of how much everyone involved contributed to the finished track.
<li>Other collaborators prefer determining the split each time they complete a session and split ownership in a composition according to the 'percentage' of contribution to the song. For instance, a person can say that they completed most of the song but the other person helped by adding a catchy bridge. So the other person can get 10%, 20%, or more, depending on what the collaborators find a fair percentage.
<li>
    Another method designates the music as 50% and lyrics as 50%. If there are two writers involved (a lyricist and composer), the split will be a simple 50-50.
    <p>Whatever method you prefer using to split co-writing credit and publishing revenues, you need to get it in writing immediately upon finishing the track. You shouldn't wait or memories will get fuzzy, and memory is a complicated matter and it won't take long for tempers to flare.</p>

    <h2>Should you split the publishing with producers?</h2>

    <p>Publishing is a confusing topic to begin with, even when you're only talking about a simple co-songwriting collaboration. Now if you've introduced producers and beatmakers, how will that alter the production process of the song? How will royalties reflect that?</p>
    <p>Before you get too further, you need to revisit the basics. In the eyes of the law, the composition copyright for the song will be governed by the melody and lyrics, nothing more.</p>
    <p>So a song is basically the melody and words. Not the groove, not the chords, not the tempo, not the arrangement, not the synth stabs, not the beat, not the bass, not the sick guitar leads.</p>
    <p>If you're alone responsible to write the melody and lyrics. You'll be the songwriter and the sole owner of the song's publishing rights.</p>
    <p>However, everyone knows that any of the extras mentioned above could be seen as an integral part of the song turning it from silver to gold.</p>
    <p>If so, there can be an argument for that collaborator (the producer, arranger, beatmaker, session player) having an ownership stake in the composition. If years down the line, the elements that they've contributed to the track are regarded as inseparable from the underlying composition in the mind of listeners.</p>
    <p>Another common practice would be to write to music that has already been created by a beatmaker or a producer. When you're writing the melody and lyrics to a track that already exists, there can be an argument that can be made that you wouldn't even have written this song it wasn't for that pre-existing music. Will this be worth a share of publishing?</p>
    <h2>Should your producer get publishing and songwriting credit?</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="/img-temp/470-Should-your-producer-get-publishing-and-songwriting-credit.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Should your producer get publishing and songwriting credit?" alt="Should your producer get publishing and songwriting credit?">
    </p>
    <p>The short answer to this question is maybe. While the letter of the law says you don't necessarily have to give the credit in every case, but there are certain cases in which credit has to be given.</p>
    <p>Publishers and labels created a defined royalty system long ago, where the producers would be granted points on the income generated from the sale and usage of a sound recording, but they were generally not given any songwriting credit for their production work.</p>
    <p>This was sort of a middle-ground, recognizing that production is like a magic process that turns a particular sound recording into a big hit, while also respective songwriters who are aiming to create compositions that shine in a number of different production contexts.</p>
    <p>It is already known that a certain hook, groove, riff, etc. can make the magic happen in the track. If your beatmaker or producer added something to the finished track, this might later be viewed as essential to someone's impression of this composition. It isn't unreasonable to share a portion of that track's publishing with them. It is a common consideration in EDM and hip-hop genres.</p>

    <h2>Publishing companies vs. record labels</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="/img-temp/470-Publishing-companies-vs-record-labels.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Publishing companies vs. record labels" alt="Publishing companies vs. record labels">
    </p>
    <p>People love to toss around the term 'publishing' a lot. So “who owns publishing?” “Who is getting the publishing on a certain track?” “Where is my publishing money?”</p>
    <p>'Publishing', 'composition', and 'songwriting' basically all mean the same thing. You're talking about royalties and songwriting ownership here.</p>
    <p>While publishing companies represent songwriters and own/control compositions, record labels, on the other hand, represent recording artists and own/control the sound recordings.</p>
    <p>If you're without a publishing company or a record label, you'll need to figure it all out on your own.</p>
    <h3>Various producer deals</h3>
    <p>Most of the time, a music producer will receive a flat fee for their contribution, in addition to the royalties on the backend. For instance, $1,500 fee paid to record the song plus 20% on the royalties.</p>
    <p>For indie artist deals (small indie labels or self-released), producers will typically get 15-25% of net royalties. The 'net' here will be defined after the producer's fee, recording costs, and third-party costs like manufacturing, distribution, etc. are subject to recoupment. In some cases, marketing costs can be included too, but that'll be negotiable.</p>
    <h3>Points and royalties</h3>
    <p>For major record label deals, the producers these days get 'points'. In most of the situations, the points are given from 3-7 points, with 3 points given for developing producers, and recognizable names getting 4-5 points, while superstar producers getting over 5 points.</p>
    <p>The 'points' are simply defined as the percentages of the artist's royalty for major label deals. In case an artist gets 18 points (percentage) for a major record deal and the produce is getting 4 points from it, the 4 will be subtracted from the artist's points. If you divide 4 by 18, the producer will be getting 22% of what the artist is getting. Meanwhile, the record label is still keeping 82%.</p>
    <p>The producers usually get their upfront fee (advance) and then the points start kicking in after the recording costs have been recouped. Unlike artist major record deals, once the recording costs have been recouped, the producer will get paid from 'record one', meaning from the first sale.</p>
    <p>You can still negotiate the backend percentage depending on the upfront fee. More money upfront will mean less percentage on the backend and vice versa.</p>
    <p>If the producer wants $3,000 upfront for a 'buy out', which means no backend percentage but the artist only has $1,500 that can be paid upfront. Then, you can kick in a 15% backend or something similar. Maybe the artist only has $500 that can be paid upfront, so the backend could be 25%.</p>
    <p>In case the artist doesn't have any money to pay upfront, then it is possible to strike a deal involving a 50/50 royalty split and the usual ownership. If the producer is getting the credits and getting the ownership, then they need to sign something that says the artist can admin the track. Because the artist will be the one promoting the track and making all of the decisions, you'll not want the producer to be able to hold anything up.</p>
    <p>The percentage numbers that come from indie deals (15% to 25%) will be based on the major label point system. Since most producers these days get 3-7 pints while most artist deals are 12-20 points of sales/streams, you can divide the producer point by artist point.</p>
    <p>In case you're working with a 4-point producer, you could divide 4 by 16 and you'll get 25%. Or you can divide 4 divided by 20 and you'd get 20% or something in between. There are obvious loose calculations as the artist royalty rate fluctuates depending on the deal.</p>
    <h2>Publishing and songwriting</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="/img-temp/470-Publishing-and-songwriting.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Publishing and songwriting" alt="Publishing and songwriting">
    </p>
    <p>Whoever wrote the track will get the publishing.</p>
    <p>If the producer had no hand in writing the song but merely helped build a track to the song, the producer will not get any publishing/songwriting credit.</p>
    <p>However, if the producer and artist created the song from scratch and basically co-write the song together, then yes, the producer will get co-writing credit and ownership. Simply, they'll get 'publishing'.</p>
    <p>In Nashville, there is a famous saying “One word, one third”.</p>This means, where there are multiple people in the room, no matter what you contribute, even if it
    <p>was just a single word, you'll be entitled to equal publishing/songwriting credit. The thought is, you have helped inspire the process and the energy in the room. The conversations that you had and the ideas that you gave helped guide the process.</p>
    <p>Every genre operates differently. In hip-hop, there are times the producer who creates the beat will demand 50% while the other top lines will have to split up the rest of the 50%. Similarly, in rock, the band will distribute who did what, and it often gets messy. In contrast, Coldplay splits into 4 equal parts no matter what. This is a safer strategy to keep the band happy.</p>
    <h2>Does the song pass the 'lone folk singer' test?</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>One experiment that can help you out would be – Imagine that you've written a song that you can perform in a stripped-down manner. Then, you go and arrange for a studio, producer, and other players. Then, you add a bunch of other stuff.</p>
    <p>Now, let's say that twenty years in the future, you're playing the song solo on stage. Will you be playing your same basic stripped-down version with voice and guitar? Or did another musician add something to the song 20 years ago that now needs to be duplicated in your solo arrangement?</p>
    <p>In case you're playing the same song that existed before, you can keep 100% of the publishing and songwriting credits. If you play other peoples' parts in your arrangement, those collaborators rightfully deserve some songwriting credit and publishing royalties.</p>
    <p>This scenario will be easier to imagine in the pop, rock, and folk realms but it would be worth considering that no matter what genre you perform in, it can always lead you to the answers that feel ethically correct while being fair to both you and the collaborators.</p>
    <p>Whatever you decide to do, it'll need to be agreed upon by all the parties involved. Moreover, it needs to be decided the minute the track is finished.</p>
