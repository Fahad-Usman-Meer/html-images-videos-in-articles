<p>Sometimes, things can get a bit baffling, especially when you're nearing the end of a long mix. In such situations, mix automation can help.</p>
<p>Maybe your compression, EQ, and send effects are dialed in to perfection yet the mix is not working smoothly. Or maybe there is little to no movement and everything seems a bit too static.</p>
<p>The easy solution to your mid-mix blues would be to introduce musical interaction between your tracks. But how does one do that when it seems like you've already added so much to the track?</p>
<p>The simple answer is mix automation.</p>
<p>Mix automation will help you in mailing down those important final steps to get the perfect mix. Whether it is your music producer saying "I've automated the EQ cutoff frequency and created an amazing filter sweet" or it is a sound engineer saying "they have made use of automation for riding the vocal track", you must have heard the word automation used at some point in time.</p>
<p>In this article, you will get to know all about automation. You will get the answers to all the questions you have always wanted to ask but were too afraid to ask. This article will go over the basics of automation, what it is, how to use it, when to use it, and more.</p>

<p>Automaton refers to the process of automation, meaning to have a computer or a robot perform particular tasks for you. In music production, automation will mean having a DAW (Pro Tools, Ableton, Logic X, etc.) automatically performs tasks for you such as moving knobs, switches, and faders for you.</p>
<p>A particularly popular use of automation in mixing would be to adjust the volume of the track. For example, it'll allow you to bring an instrument to the forefront for a moment and seamlessly fade back out once the lead vocals kick in.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-automation-in-mixing">When to use automation in mixing?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/420-when-to-use-automation-in-mixing.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="When to use automation in mixing" alt="When to use automation in mixing"></p>
<p>For answering this question, you'll need to go back in time and imagine. In the old days (say 30-40 years ago) before the mixing and music recording processes went digital and everything had to be done by hand.</p>
<p>Imagine the scenario – You are mixing a song performed by a rock hand. You have set the levels and balances such that everyone sounds great in the verse. But then you notice a problem. Once the chorus kicks in, the vocals suddenly get a bit blurry in the mix.</p>
<p>If you wanted to bring up the volume fader for the entire song, the vocal would become too loud in the verse part.</p>
<p>The solution to that? You will have to manually move the fader up when you enter the chorus. You will have to take a piece of tape and mark the side of the vocal volume fader, that during this verse section, the fader needs to be set at -8 dB and then once the chorus comes, it should be boosted to -6 dB. Each time you play this song, you will need to remember to push the fader up a bit.</p>
<p>This would solve the problem with the vocal levels. However, then you realize that the reverb that helped you make the vocals sound gorgeous on the first verse was too wet for the activity happening in the chorus. Now you would have to tasks when approaching the chorus – volume up, reverb down.</p>
<p>Soon, you find some more things that need adjusting, but there is one small problem – you only have two hands and both hands were already busy with the volume and reverb.</p>
<p>How would you get around that? You will need to have another person who will be able to help you turn additional knobs and adjust faders along with you. The more parameters that you want to change over time, the more hands you will require.</p>
<p>Instead of having five or more people running around the board and making adjustments on the fly, you could just tell your DAW to perform all these tasks for you.</p>
<p>So why to use automation in music?</p>
<ul>
    <li>It will save time</li>
    <li>It will let you create unique effects</li>
    <li>It will allow you to make adjustments with precision and exact timing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-will-you-be-able-to-use-automation">Where will you be able to use automation?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/420-where-will-you-be-able-to-use-automation.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Where will you be able to use automation" alt="Where will you be able to use automation"></p>
<p>Almost everywhere! You can easily use automation to automatically adjust all types of parameters (faders, volume, sends, panning, etc.) on your track in the DAW. You can also automate changes to settings inside the plug-ins.</p>
<p>Do you wish to bypass a plug-in for a certain part of the song? Yes, you can easily do that. Here are a few ideas to get you started –</p>
<h3>Automate an effect bypass (on/off)</h3>
<p>In certain sections of the song, you can automate an effect bypass on and off. This will be very useful if you're looking to create a delay or use a long verb tail on a few words to emphasize them.</p>
<h3>Automate a VCA or bus</h3>
<p>Automating a VCA or a bus will help you control the level of a group of instruments at the same time.</p>
<h3>Automate individual plugin parameters</h3>
<p>This will come in handy when creating EQ filter sweeps or if you wish to alter the delay feedback amount in a certain section of the song.</p>
<h3>Automate the master fader</h3>
<p>Automating the master fader will allow you to create a fade-out as your song approaches the end.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-automate-more-than-one-parameter-on-a-track-at-once">Is it possible to automate more than one parameter on a track at once?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/420-is-it-possible-to-automate-more-than-one-parameter-on-a-track-at-once.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Is it possible to automate more than one parameter on a track at once" alt="Is it possible to automate more than one parameter on a track at once"></p>
<p>Absolutely! Most modern DAWs will allow you to perform virtually limitless amounts of automation at once.</p>
<p>For instance, you can easily have the reverb send amount the fade out to 0 or near that value over the course of two bars, while at the same time having the value, the delay mix amount, and compression threshold adjusted.</p>
<p>You should be using automation any time you want to adjust a certain parameter on a track or in any plug-in of your song. If you want the adjustments on your song to happen over time as you play over that section of the song, you'll need to use automation.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-record-automation">How to record automation?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/420-how-to-record-automation.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How to record automation" alt="How to record automation"></p>
<p>In most modern DAWs, you get three main options to record automation –</p>
<ul>
    <li>You could perform your change by moving the knob/fader/button directly on the plug-in or channel strip</li>
    <li>You could draw it in manually using a mouse</li>
    <li>You could perform the changes using an assigned knob/fader/button on the MIDI controller and have the DAW record the adjustments</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily refer to the DAW's manual for the exact procedure to do either of these, as each DAW will have its unique way of assigning controllers and recording the automaton.</p>
<p>Drawing in automation will probably be one of the fastest ways to achieve precise results. You might have different tools available to you depending on your choice of DAW.</p>
<p>In Logic, you can click on the automation line for creating a new point. Each point could be easily moved to the desired location and it'll result in a straight line between the two points. Then, you could use the Automation Curve Tool for giving the automation curves and add a bit of smoothness to the sound. This will be useful if you are trying to gradually speed up/slow down the movement of the parameter that you're changing.</p>
<p>Finally, you will be able to 'draw' in the changes using the Pencil Tool (also called the Paint tool). In this mode, the mouse will be treated as a brush, which will allow you to freely 'paint' the automation. For better results, you should reference your DAWs manual as it'll show the information on tools available to you.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-different-automation-modes">What are the different automation modes?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/420-what-are-the-different-automation-modes.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="What are the different automation modes" alt="What are the different automation modes"></p>
<p>Automation modes will determine how the automation is treated on particular tracks. In its most basic form, automation is either read or written. In most DAWs, you get the option to independently set the automation mode for each track. Most audio recording/mixing/editing programs tend to follow the following four automation modes –</p>
<h3>Read</h3>
<p>When the track is set to this mode, the DAW will play back the automation that exists on the track.</p>
<p>For instance, if data that adjusts the volume is present, the volume fader will automatically move during playback after the recorded automation on the track.</p>
<p>Moving controls will have no effect on anything on a permanent basis because no new data is recorded in this mode. As its name suggests, the 'Read Only' mode will only read the information that already exists.</p>
<h3>Touch</h3>
<p>This mode will play back automation in the exact same way as the previous mode (read mode).</p>
<p>However, in the 'Touch Mode', you can easily modify the value of the chosen automation parameters by moving the controls (in a plug-in, on your track, or on your MIDI controller) during playback.</p>
<p>Once the knob or fader is released, the parameter will revert back and following existing automation on the track.</p>
<p>This mode will be useful only if you want to touch up certain parts of the automation without affecting the rest.</p>
<h3>Latch</h3>
<p>This mode will work just like the 'Touch Mode', but once the knob or fader is released, the last parameter value on which the knob or fader was released will replace the existing automation on the track.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it'll latch onto the last value that you moved your knob or fader to and continue writing/replacing anything that follows as you continue playing back.</p>
<h3>Write</h3>
<p>This mode is the most intense automation recording mode as it'll erase any existing automation on the track as the 'playhead' passes over it. In this mode, the DAW will record the new control movement or delete the existing data if you do nothing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be up to you to decide which of these four modes you want to use. You could easily switch between the modes and use the ones that you're comfortable with.</p>

<h2 id="does-automation-work-differently-in-different-daws">Does automation work differently in different DAWs?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/420-does-automation-work-differently-in-different-daws.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Does automation work differently in different DAWs" alt="Does automation work differently in different DAWs"></p>
<p>Yes! Each DAW will have a slightly different way to record, display, and edit automation information. With the advancement in DAW technology, DAWs have streamlined the process and today, you will find that most of them do things pretty similarly, though Ableton Live is an exception.</p>Almost all modern Digital Audio Workstations including Studio One, Logic Pro X, Cubase, Reaper, and Pro Tools, among others, use the standardized method to deal with automation, where you get the option to select parameters and the automation modes before you record automation data.</p>You will also be able to record automation during playback with you're using the touch, latch, and write modes.</p>However, Ableton 10 has introduced a lot of improvements in how automation data is presented. The recording of automation data is largely still more cumbersome as compared to other DAWs. In Ableton 10, the automation data will be treated like any other data – it won't exist until you record the modes that are to be selected.</p>The parameter changes that exist on the track get read on playback and can only be overwritten while recording.</p>

Of course! In fact, most musicians frequently use automation as a creative tool. If you have ever come across an EQ frequency sweep building up to the beat drop, you will know that it can be used to create great tension build-up.</p>You can try using automation for panning an instrument back and forth between the right and left speakers. You can even bring up the delay on certain phases to emphasize them or use automation to get the distorting plug-in turn on your lead vocal for just the bridge.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Final Verdict</h2>
Automation is a great tool that you could use to bring static elements in your track to life. You should definitely give it a try and see if it helps you. As mentioned earlier, you should reference your DAW's manual to get exact instructions on how you should record, edit, and playback automation data.</p>
