<p>Hip hop is one music genre that has undergone a series of transformations that have lasted for over 7 decades. We all agree that beats are an important component not only in hip hop sounds but in other music genres as well. Most importantly, the creation of beats could be your biggest nightmare, if you're thinking of joining the hip hop world. It must be remembered that most hip hop beats are created from drum patterns, a subset of drum programming. Ideally, drum programming is one of the most interesting sections of music production that's responsible for creating beats that blend perfectly with a hip-hop sound.</p>

<p>Although it's a key element in music production, drum programming is not a simple process, and it requires seasonal producers to successfully implement it. This, however, does not mean that coming up with your own hip-hop drum pattern is an impossible task. In fact, it's a process that can take less than an hour provided you know how to select the samples. Selecting the samples that match perfectly with a given track is the only difficult part in creating a hip hop drum pattern.</p>

<p>Happily, with hip hop, you cannot lack a sample of drum patterns that you can use for your hip hop music. Producers have different opinions on what comes first between melodies and drums. While some producers insist that melodies should come first, others believe that melodies should be built from drums. Regardless of what comes first in your music, the roles of drums in music are one thing that cannot be taken for granted. Let's look at the advantages of drum patterns to hip-hop music.</p>
<h3>The drum pattern is hip hop</h3>

<p>Although different components make music, including hip hop, hip hop is nothing without drum patterns. It's worth noting that all the powerful hip-hop songs in history were built around drum patterns. Some of the tracks beautiful tracks that made that were built around drum patterns include the 1992 track by Ice Cube "It was a good day". If you have listened to another incredible hip hop track "all I need" that was released two years after "It was a good day", then you know what it means by building a music track around drum patterns. In the two powerful hip-hop tracks, it's solely drum patterns that helped them to stand. You'll be mistaken to imagine that the two tracks are the only ones that benefited from drum patterns. The list is endless and the significance of drum patterns can be witnessed in all hip hop generation. It may be true that drums are used differently in the hip hop sector; their patterns are what have to give hip hop tracks life. When selecting a drum pattern for your music, it's prudent to know that not every drum pattern can suit every hip-hop sound.</p>

<p>This is one thing that many upcoming hip-hop producers have been doing wrong. Although we're not experts when it comes to programming drums, having a lead instrument in your drum pattern will make your track stand out. Being a drummer can be more challenging since the success of the hip hop melody, as well as beats, lie squarely on their shoulders. If you want to succeed as a drummer, then proper timing is something that you should master. Drums do not carry much value in hip hop alone. It has deeper foundations in other music genres such as rock, R&B, Classical music, and many others.</p>

<h3>Drum Pattern communicates the story</h3>

<p>On top of entertainment, songs are tools for passing useful information. From history, hip hop is renowned for outlining challenges that are common in society. It's worth noting that this was the common message that was in the world of hip hop in the 90s that saw both drugs and violence become the common agendas. Hip hop has succeeded in driving messages home with the help of a drum pattern. It's important to realize that melodies create musical value, but you need drum patterns to create emotions that drive your song. A good number of hip-hop producers understand this, that's why they build everything, including melodies and vocals around the drums. A professional hip-hop drummer must understand how to create emotions by varying the intensity of drums.</p>

<p>Although there multiple ways that hip hop producers can depend on whenever they want to attain this, the easiest way is to increase or reduce the prominence of the hip hop drum pattern. Consequently, drum pattern has the power of carrying the tone of your hip hop track. For example, in the song "When I am gone" which was sang by Eminem a couple of years ago, a drum pattern was used to create a sad tone. In the same fashion in the first track that they released in the early 90s by NWA, it was drum patterns that created a harsh tone in the song. Want to know who is the best hip-hop producer in the sector...? Well, the quality of drum patterns is everything that you need to measure.</p>

<p>This can sound absurd, but drum patterns are used to measure the creativity of not only the artist but also the producers. It may not be common with other music genres but hip hop beats are created by blending samples of drums from other music genres such as soul, hop, R&B, older versions of hip hop plus others. It's only a sharp producer that can come up with a unique as well as powerful sound by mixing all these samples.</p>

<h3>Drums pattern is the history of hip hop</h3>

You can think that they're obsessed with their beats which is not always the point. In one of the top school music lectures, one professor told us that there's one thing that history gives but cannot be seen. In most cases, history will provide the metrics for measuring the transformation journey. Most hip-hop producers feel excited when they realize that their hip-hop drum beats are better than what was there tens of decades ago.</p>

<p>Consequently, the mind of a hip-hop producer is often on how to improve drum patterns that's why little emphasis is placed on hip-hop. In other words, an excellent hip-hop track is the effect of proper manipulation of what can broadly be described as drum sounds. As pointed out before, removing drum patterns from hip hop is the first step of bringing the genre to an untimely death.
