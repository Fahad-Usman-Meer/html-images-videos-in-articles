<p>If you aren't mixing or mastering engineer, you will probably have loads of questions about what the two processes are and how do they differ. The knowledge and technical talk of gear leave even the most experienced music artists feeling confused. Outside of the engineers themselves, very few people actually know what happens during these final stages.</p>
<p>This mystery often leads to misinformation as some consider the two processes to be the same or discard one unnecessary if they've performed the other.</p>
<p>To clear out all the issues and queries about mixing and mastering, let's look at what the two processes are and what are the key differences between the two.</p>

<p>After all of the tracks of a song are recorded, a mixing engineer will step in and work their magic. The engineer will start by labeling and organizing the tracks into similar groups while the song will be normalized to ensure that the tracks are at similar volume levels and without any tracks peak.</p>
<p>They will then EQ check the individual tracks to get the best tones out of the instruments and make use of low and high pass filters to eliminate unneeded frequencies.</p>
<p>The general goal of EQing is for making adjustments that allow the tracks to inhabit their own frequency areas. This will allow the instruments in the song to be clear and distinguishable.</p>
<p>The same idea will be applied to panning the tracks and get a full, wide sound. Compression, delay, reverb, and other processes will be added to each track for getting the desired tones for the instruments.</p>

<p>The mastering engineer will receive the stereo track with notes and reference songs from the engineers or the artists. This will give the engineer a better understanding of the sound that they're going for such that the mix isn't altered in areas that are meant to sound a certain way.</p>
<p>Then, the finishing touches are added to the track by making adjustments primarily to the EQ, limiting, compression, and stereo enhancement. All of the songs that are mastered on an album are brought to similar levels so that the album flows properly and is cohesive throughout.</p>
<p>Moreover, spacing and fades will be added to the beginning and end of the songs. Most mastering engineers generally offer sequencing services for to put the songs in an album in a desired order and encode the tracks with ISRC.</p>
<p>The primary goal of a mastering engineer is to provide high clarity, high fidelity, professional sound that can be enjoyed by the audience on any source.</p>

<h3>Perspective</h3>
<p>The best way to know about the difference between the two processes is by understanding an overview of the tasks carried out during the two processes.</p>

<p>Mixing will mark the start of post-production, where the engineer caves and balances separate tracks into a session to sound good when played together. Having tools like EQ, reverb, panning, and compression at their disposal, mix engineers can easily reduce clashes between instruments and emphasize important song elements.</p>

<p>In many cases, they may even choose to layer drum hits with samples from outside that session or even mute redundant instrument parts.</p>

<p>Mix engineers will also have to consider if their decisions would serve the arc of a song, which could only be communicated by an artist explicitly or understood by an experienced mixer.</p>

<p>A mastering engineer, on the other hand, will take the stereo mixdown and correct and enhance sonic elements to ensure optimal playback quality on all systems and formats before distribution.</p>

<p>They are also looking to achieve a sense of balance, but across and between separate songs of an album. In case song one through three is bubble gum pop, the fourth song is a downtempo ballad, and the fifth song is a dancehall-influenced, what decisions will have to be made regarding timbre and level for smoothing the transitions between these disparate styles?</p>

<p>A mastering engineer will require experience and attentiveness that no other person in the music industry has. The mastering requires extra special skills to make changes to the way something sounds, catch potential mistakes, and the decisions made at this stage are what will appear on copies and duplicates of the song.</p>

<h3>Track count</h3>
<p>Once the producer finishes a song, it will be handed off to a mix engineer as a full session or folder of stems for them to work on. This could either be a small session with a few tracks or a 100+ track session complete with multi-part harmonies, vocal doubles, and other backgrounds.</p>

<p>Mastering engineers make the final touches to a project. The restriction of the file format is part of what makes the mix phase (and the recording and production phases before it) so important. There is only so much that you can do with a stereo recording.</p>

<p>Mastering engineers cannot actually go into the project to sculpt a kick drum, unmask the vocals, or filter a synth. They'll make broad adjustments and enhancements to the whole mix, keeping in mind the market standards and the artist's vision.</p>

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>There are a few key differences in workflow between mixing and mastering, regardless of the genre. Since mixers receive multiple tracks, a large chunk of their job, at least in the earlier stages, will be organizational in nature, labeling, color-coding tracks, creating instrument groups, ordering them hierarchically in a DAW, and more.</p>

<p>Once all this is done, a mixer will proceed to creative tasks like transient shaping, filtering, and effects automation to allow separate tracks in a song to blend well together.</p>

<p>Depending on how the production sounds when it reaches the mix engineer, a full song mix could take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. This long-time investment requires mixing engineers to develop a routine to maintain focus while avoiding ear fatigue.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to start with drums? Or vocals? Should you leave the tasks that you least enjoy till the end or should you get them out of the way first?</p>

<p>Mastering engineers should also be very organized but with a narrowed focus. A typical mastering session will go something like this –</p>

<ul>
    <li>Critical thinking – What does this song require to hit marked and genre standards? Should you change anything? How to order the signal path?</li>

    <li>Set levels for songs that are based on character, genre, and release format.</li>

    <li>Apply compression and broad EQ for improving tonal balance when A/Bing the master with the gain matched original version for quality control.</li>

    <li>Consider how individual songs on an EP or an album work together. Is the loudness and character of each song uniform and consistent?</li>

    <li>Prepare export settings on the basis of listening format. This could involve adjusting levels for resampling, conversion, and generating documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the creative changes that happen during the mastering stage are much more subtle than the ones at the mixing stage (generally EQ changes are around 1 dB up or down). However, since they're made to a stereo file, there will be unexpected consequences that should be listened to.</p>

<p>Will a cut in the low-end add edge in the presence range? Given how close the song is to completion, once it has reached a mastering studio, the whole process rarely takes beyond an hour, so the full album could be completed in a day.</p>

<h3>The room</h3>
<p>For distinguishing noises in a recording from something that is present in the ambient environment, most mastering engineers prefer to work in treated rooms that are relatively quiet.</p>

<p>You will simply not be able to hear the quietest detail in a song if there is a heater hum in the background, the audible conversation in the room, or traffic outside.</p>

<p>As the last person in the creative process right before distribution and replication, the mastering engineer should not reply on guesswork.</p>

<p>While such rooms can be beneficial to mix engineers, they're typically more mobile than mastering counterparts. A lot of mixers sideline as producers and even find themselves moving from one studio to the other with artists on a project.</p>

<p>To make sure the mix translates well across a range of playback environments, they'll also switch between headphones, monitors, and laptops to get a different perspective and suss out tonal balance issues.</p>

<p>This type of jumping around doesn't usually happen with mastering. For maintaining a point of reference, most engineers tend to stay put in one room that they know very well. A modern pop album can easily explore electronic, hip-hop, and sentimental ballads with separate mixers handling each style. It can be a challenge to establish a sense of flow from one song to the other if the setup was changed every few hours.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>There is a ton of crossover in the tools that are used by mixing and mastering engineers with a few key exceptions. Starting with DAW, at the most basic level, mastering is all about improving a mixed-down stereo file. Most DAWs that host plug-ins and have great editing options are appropriate for mastering.</p>

<p>Depending on the format, the music will be released on, and the distribution strategy, a mastering engineer will then work with additional programs to create documentation about the master.</p>

<p>Today, with the internet as the most popular distribution channel, engineers will submit metadata to streaming platforms that'll include artist names, track duration, song names, and more.</p>

<p>A second tool that is unique to mastering is a limiter. It is used for bringing loudness levels to market standards, a song will not have to be the loudest thing around though it should be within the ballpark of similar music.</p>

<p>Essentially, a compressor with a 10:1 ratio, limiters will be placed at the end of the mastering chain for catching the loudest moment in the song as input gain is increased. This will allow engineers to boost the quieter parts without actually pushing the highest peaks parts into distortion.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mixing will create a balance between individual elements and transform them into a cohesive whole. Mastering, on the other hand, will take the whole track and give it the final polish. You could create a mix without mastering but you cannot master a track without mixing it first.</li>

    <li>Mixing will give you access to every instrument used in that song. While mastering, you will only have access to the final mix, which will make altering the balance between individual elements far more difficult.</li>

    <li>During both the mixing and mastering stages, you should be striving to achieve balance. The difference will be that during mixing, you are trying to balance individual instruments. During mastering, you are trying to balance complete songs and spectral content. In simple words, mixing will make instruments sound great together while mastering will make songs sound great together.</li>

    <li>Generally, mixing sessions could be huge. A simple pop or rock arrangement can contain 32+ tracks while complex projects could have track counts in hundreds. Mastering sessions typically contain one stereo or multitrack per song or maybe multiple stems.</li>

    <li>When you're mixing, you have to make a lot of adjustments. Some of them are quite heavy-handed. After all, the tweaks will only affect that particular element. Mastering, on the other hand, is the exact opposite. It will use subtle broad strokes that'll affect the entire song.</li>

    <li>The mixing process is all about enhancing the vision of the artist, making sure that the original emotional intent is conveyed. Mastering will be focused on sound quality. It will also ensure that the song sounds just as good (if not better) than everyone else's.</li>

<h2>Conclusion: The Final Verdict</h2>
<p>For people who are new to the audio world, mixing and mastering can feel a bit less accessible than production or playing instruments. Hopefully, this article will help you get a better grasp of what mixing and mastering are all about and the importance of these post-production steps.</p>
