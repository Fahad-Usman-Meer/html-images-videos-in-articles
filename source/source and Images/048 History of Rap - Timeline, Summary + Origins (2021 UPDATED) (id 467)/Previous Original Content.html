<p>Rap is defined as talk or chat easily and familiarly.</p>

<p>That's what google tells you. And it's correct. So Rap is essentially a speech in a rhythmic way and nothing more than that. Rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing.</p>

<p>Let's fall back to the history of this beauty of art form which rules the world right now.</p>

<p>First of all Rap Music is a part of Hip Hop culture.</p>

<p>Hip hop is not a music form. Hip hop is a lifestyle with a developed and colorful culture, its language, and fashion style, specific kind of music, and thinking.

<p>Some say it's exactly the decade of the 1970s when hip hop came to light through block parties on the streets of New York City. In 1970, Afrika Bambaataa, the "godfather of hip hop culture" started with DJing. We will come to DJing later.</p>

<p>According to some; hip hop was born on August 11, 1973, on the west side of Bronx, when DJ Kool Herc, the brother of Cindy Campbell, gave a block party, where this new music style came into existence. DJ Kool Herc is often called the "father of hip hop".</p>

<p>It is believed that the roots of rap reach far into the past as this provocative project shows. The rapping technique has been present in many American musical genres, for 100 years or more, including early rural music, both black and white, religious songs, blues, ragtime, vaudeville, and hokum. This album features rap precursors by such legendary figures in American music as Blind Willie Johnson, Pine Top Smith, Memphis Jug Band, Butterbeans and Susie, Seven Foot Dilly & His Dill Pickles, Dixieland Jug Blowers, Jimmie Davis, Blind Willie McTell, and more! A highly entertaining and provocative exploration into early American musical history.</p>

<p>Rap sounds very simple and the delivery of this music form often happens over a beat, typically provided by a DJ but be it your street corner or world stage rap and hip hop has grown into one of the world's most prominent musical genres and cultural influences.</p>

<p>Some prominent musicians and songwriters say that Hip Hop and Rap Music have ruined the generic and old-style music forms but Hip hop is more than music.</p>

<p>To this day, hip hop continues to be a global phenomenon since it has the potential to develop new art forms that impact the lives of new and old generations.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the first known era of Hip hop. It's believed that this art form is a subculture and an art movement that emerged from the Bronx in New York City during the early 1970s. Its development reflected the negative effects of post-industrial decline, political discourse, and a rapidly changing economy.</p>

<p>History shows that during that time New York City was suffering from economic collapse. The reason behind that being the decline of the manufacturing industry and the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway.</p>

<p>
    Much of the white middle class moved to the suburbs to escape the social and economic challenges. The migration shifted demographics and segregated communities. Conditions worsened in neighborhoods prominently populated by African-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Caribbean immigrants. Urban despair also brought rising crime, gang violence, and poverty.
    Because of that the particular part of the society suffered since businesses closed their doors, causing many throats to dry. And when that happens young gen comes to the street to express themselves. The abandoned buildings and parking lots set the stage for block parties. That's where in midst of poverty, struggle, and desperation HIP HOP was born.
</p>

<p>Music has the magic to rise pain thresholds among people and the society and black community were suffering from anger, hardship, and abandonment at that time. However, the emerging hip hop movement transformed despair and racial barriers into numerous creative outlets. Hip Hop essentially became an outlet to deal with violence.</p>

<p>That's the reason the lyrics of most of the rap songs are written with important life lessons with just catchphrases and one-liners in a very inspiring and encouraging way. And, unfortunately, Hip Hop is often confused with spectacular jewelry rappers who are rich and successful. People who aren't aware of the history of hip-hop don't know that it is such a complex area that includes music, dance, and art such as graffiti, fashion, and many other fields which are connected with it.</p>

<p>Hip Hop has four essential elements: Djing, MCing, graffiti art, and b-boying. They existed separately for some time, but when they collaborated it made hip hop.</p>

<p>Let's know about these elements.</p>

<p>DJing is a fundamental means to produce hip-hop music. DJ is what provides melody to the RAP singer. The DJ is the abbreviation for the phrase ‘disc jockey' – a person, who plays recorded, not live, music or sound for an audience.</p>

<p>MCing is often used as a synonym for rapping, but it is just one part of what an MC does. The MC is the acronym of the phrase ‘master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>B-boying is a kind of street dance and it is often called ‘breakdancing' or ‘breaking'. It was inspired by dance elements of other dance styles that already existed, but breakers except that they adopt new ones. Rap music is often performed without this element.</p>

<p>Nelson George wrote an excellent piece called Hip Hop America. He wrote that graffiti has been around since man encountered his first stone wall. Graffiti has indeed been in existence for centuries, but this kind of graffiti has nothing in common with hip-hop culture. The style of graffiti that is liked to hip hop was born in Philadelphia at the end of the 1960s, where graffiti writers such as Cornbread, Cool Earl, and Top Cat had been painting the walls since 1967. This modern graffiti art is also called ‘writing' or ‘aerosol art'.</p>

<p>Apart from these basic elements of Hip Hop and as it was rising and spreading, another element began to enter the hip hop culture. In the 1980s, Afrika Bambaataa, one of the excellent DJs, tried to enforce a fifth element that was called "Knowledge, Culture and Overstanding." It consisted of comprehending the principles laid by the hip hop pioneers and the conceptual history of the preceding elements. The term "overstanding" contained a positivist ideology taken from Rastafarianism, which emphasized a superior positive power, not on the negative one.</p>

<h2>1980's</h2>

<p>Now in the 1980s Rap music is known by everyone. Let's have a look at the major events that took place.</p>

<p>The rappers developed their kind of presence and style and as hip hop became national music, the people listening to this kind of music needed to identify with it by selecting a particular kind of clothes. Clothing companies and shoe manufacturers such as Adidas, Nike, and Timberland gave them this opportunity. This specific clothing includes pieces such as saggy pants, oversized T-shirts, hooded coats and sweatshirts, and hip hop caps.</p>

<p>Now hip hop came to radio and started to be played at every home so Hollywood started making films and documentaries about hip hop, and publishing magazines influenced by hip hop, the local culture spread across the whole country. In 1982, the first universal hip hop tour called the Roxy Tour was held in Europe. It consisted of Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmixer DXT & the Infinity 17 Rappers. In 1983 was released a hip-hop documentary Wild Style that captures all of the four basic elements of hip hop. In 1986, MC Shan released a record "The Bridge," which initiated one of the most long-lasting battles in the whole history of hip hop, the Bridge Wars. A year later, a hip hop trio Salt-n-Pepa produced a record "Push It" which was one of the first rap records nominated for the Grammy Award. In 1988, hip hop grabbed the attention of mass media, when rap artists DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince from Philadelphia won with their single "Parents Just Don't Understand" the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance.</p>

<h2>1990's</h2>

<p>By the 1990s, hip hop was the dominant force in popular culture. It was a most crucial decade for hip hop and rap music.</p>

<p>26 years after releasing successful records and albums, appearing on national TV and radio stations, and winning some of the highly regarded awards, numerous hip hop artists became icons of popular culture. At the beginning of this decade, gangsta rappers such as Tupac Shakur, Ice-T, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg got a chance to get into the spotlight of major record labels which found out that they can earn a lot of money by selling something scandalous, and this paralyzed music production on the East Coast scene for a certain period. 1991, Tung Twista was registered in the Guinness Book of Records for being the fastest rapper in the world. In the same year, 2 Live Crew published the first live rap album called Live in Concert. In 1993, Quincy Jones started to publish Vibe magazine that became the major competitor of the Source. In August 1999, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum organized the first dominant exhibition concerning hip hop culture, which is called "Roots, Rhymes, and Rage: Jay-Z won a Grammy Award for the best album, but he proclaimed that the Grammy Awards did not honor rap and refused to appear on the show hip hop conflict arose also in the 1990s.</p>

<h2>East Coast vs. West Coast</h2>

<p>The East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry was going on between artists from Bad Boy Records based in New York, Death Row Records residing in Los Angeles, and their fans. The central figures were West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur and East Coast rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (Christopher Wallace). The initiator of this conflict was rapper Tim Dog who released a record "Fuck Compton" in 1991, which was pointed to several artists from Compton such as N.W.A. that started to gain the attention of hip hop fans. November 30, 1994, Tupac Shakur was shot several times and robbed in New York's studio, and he accused Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy (Sean Combs) from Bad Boy Records of attempted murder. This was the key event, or at least the most potent symbol, of the so-called war. Tupac Shakur, who was born in New York, signed to Death Row Records, which worsened the whole situation that ended in several deaths. In 1996, Tupac released the record "Hit Em Up" pointed at people from Bad Boy Records, and later in the year, more precisely, on the 7th September 1996, he was shot to death In Las Vegas by an unknown suspect. In 1997, Notorious B.I.G. released the record "Hypnotize," and on the 9th March 1997, he was shot to death in Los Angeles also by an unknown assailant. Many years after the end of the East Coast vs. West Coast conflict, the identity of the murderers is not known, and the connection between the murders and East Coast/West Coast rivalry is also not proven.</p>

<p>There have been many documentaries and many movies made and released on this rivalry too.</p>

</p>2000's</h2>

<p>Hip hop in the 2000s built on its successes, especially in the area of music when hip hop artists were very often nominated for numerous music awards and they won many of them. For example serve Eminem, who thanks to his album The Marshall Mather Lp, which sold approximately two million pieces during the first week, became the first white rapper that won a Grammy Award in the category of rap in 2000. Among other hip hop achievements belong the induction of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. into the Hip Hop Hall of Fame in 2002.</p>

<p>Today is the young generation of rappers like Drake, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and others.</p>

<p>There are female rappers who are topping the charts for a while now too Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, and Megan Thee Stallion.</p>

<p>Now a day's rap music is very popular and pure.</p>

<p>And it's the responsibility of the rappers to make sure that rap music is not associated with violence, money, drugs, and guns.</p>

<p>Rap music was made in struggle and it should represent peace and harmony.</p>
