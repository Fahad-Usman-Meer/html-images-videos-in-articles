<p>Just because you are an independent artist or you work in the music sector, that doesn't mean you have to do it by yourself. The Musicians' Union was formed back in the day to represent you, help you, and support you. This is your profession, your source income, and they can help you in protecting your future and your hard work.</p>
<p>Similar to any other union, the MU has the best interests of musicians at heart. The MU represents over 30,000 musicians across the UK who are working in the music sector, from artists to even music teachers. The goal of this community is to protect the rights of its members and the music it creates, while also connecting musicians and supporters.</p>
<h2>Why do musicians need a union?</h2>
<p>The entertainment world is one of the most unique industries across the world. This industry can be a ruthless warzone that can isolate and destroy people. Money is a huge motivator and corrupter in the world, and it, unfortunately, has a place in music too.</p>
<p>No two music artists are alike, but most of them begin creating music out of their desire and love for music. The music industry is there to monetize this love and passion for music.</p>
<p>It creates the precipice of the clash that most musicians run into throughout their music careers.</p>
<p>The business side of this industry can be quite confusing and difficult to navigate. If you wish to be a doctor, you can go to a medical school, then do your residency, and eventually work your way up through the ranks into medical practice.</p>
<p>The career path of a musician isn't as prescribed and comes with several peaks and valleys, twists and turns.</p>
<p>Especially in the era of sharing and streaming of content, as well as the tumultuous political climates, the business aspect of music needs to be handled carefully. Independent artists are challenging record label-signed acts for the number of streams, downloads, radio plays, and more, which is why it is more important than ever that they are afforded support and protection for their music.</p>
<p>Moreover, for musicians, music teachers, and others looking for stability, the MU can help them find music jobs and make important connections.</p>
<h2>History of Musicians' Union</h2>
<p>In 1893, the Amalgamated Musicians Union was formed in Manchester (later renamed to the Musician' Union in 1921). Within its first few years, the Union supported the striking of theatre workers in Liverpool after they had to go through pay cuts and longer working hours.</p>
<p>For more than 120 years, the MU has lobbied for pair practices, fair pay, and the protection of the intellectual property of musicians.</p>
<p>They are now in possession of a massive archive of letters, complaints, and details of experiences that members have faced over the years. The archives are now kept at the University of Stirling, Scotland.</p>
<p>These days, the national office of MU is in London while they have six regional offices around the country.</p>
<p>While the MU is the only music industry union in the UK, there are numerous other supportive organizations working within the music.</p>
<h2>Who works at the Musician's Union?</h2>
<p>The entire executive team at the Musicians' Union provides proper backing and works as a community from the top down. The whole union is made up largely of musicians, unlike corporate structures in many areas of the music industry, you'll get an executive team that has your best interests at heart and is by your side all the time.</p>
<p>The National Office team is made up of several specialized teams, including Education and Training, Communications and Government Relations, Live Performance, Legal, Orchestral, Recording and Broadcasting, and more.</p>
<h2>Membership Fees</h2>
<p>There are many expenses in the music industry, and while all of it sounds like a great resource, many up-and-coming musicians aren't typically flush with cash.</p>
<p>The MU understands how it is to be intertwined with the industry, which is why the MU offers different types of memberships.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For supporters of the Union, you'll be able to join for free</li>
    <li>For first-time musician members, you'll be able to join for a pound for the first 6 months</li>
    <li>A full-time membership for returning members will cost you 221 pounds for a year</li>
    <li>If you're a member of the EIS, UCU, or NUT, you can enjoy a reduced membership for 110.50 pounds annually</li>
    <li>Students can join for 19.60 pounds a year</li>
</ul>
<p>It is truly a cutthroat world out there, especially in the music industry. Most musicians today start off with the vision of becoming a famous rock star and a celebrity. They soon find out that it takes a lot of effort, sacrifices, and luck to do that.</p>
<p>Instead, the music industry is a gritty and difficult place to navigate. However, the end result is worth it.</p>
<p>The Musicians' Union will help you strategically navigate the tough world while making sure your rights are protected. It'll give you the backing you need to defend your rights while making sure you have a fair shot at getting the career you've always dreamt of. There is absolutely no reason for you not to join the best community of musicians, especially if you're an independent musician.</p>
<h2>What does the Musicians' Union do?</h2>
<p>The Musicians' Union does a great job of providing information and resources for anyone with a music-related job so that they can navigate this tricky industry. Moreover, their work goes way beyond this.</p>
<h3>Advice</h3>
<p>On the MU's website, the ‘Advice' page is an important page, especially if you're a musician trying to learn and understand what to do if you want to make it.</p>
<p>The page features several sections for advice on your career, songwriting and composing, playing live, recording and broadcasting, and music education. Each of the subpages comes with recent news items on the subject to keep you up-to-date with everything going on in the music industry.</p>
<p>It is important that you should know all of the different elements that are involved in producing music. Recording and touring are necessary for your career, however, both are completely different and come with their own set of challenges.</p>
<p>The resources offered by the MU can empower indie artists with the knowledge they're seeking so that they can be taken seriously as musicians.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get your music licensed or you need help understanding mechanical rights and performing rights, the MU will give you all the knowledge you need. In case you feel your rights aren't being respected or you aren't being paid what you should, the MU will assist you.</p>
<h3>Union support</h3>
<p>While having resources in the form of info is great, but the support and protection that a union can provide are even more important. If you're an independent musician, you'll likely be familiar with less than reputable booking agents, studio owners, and venue owners. As sad as it might be to need protection against the worst of mankind, but it is necessary.</p>
<p>The MU sets out to make a number of situations right including making sure performs are properly paid for their performance, support for music teachers, and ensuring copyright and performers' rights are protected, among others. The MU provides solidarity while making use of the resources of the large community for ensuring that you're protected.</p>
<p>The MU works hard in getting the government to support the rights of its members, including the intellectual property rights of the musicians. Several indie artists operate within the ‘Small and Medium Enterprises (SME)' band and heavily rely on the protection of their rights for income. The MU acts to evoke change as it has the best interests of British musicians at heart.</p>
<h3>Forum</h3>
<p>Contracts are very important within the music industry. Having a broad spectrum of members, the MU members forum connects and unites the music makers. Whether you're looking for band members, collaboration opportunities, industry professionals, or teachers, the members will be able to search via skill, style, or location.</p>
<p>Another helpful feature would be the Stolen Instruments Bulletin that aims to help victims of theft get back their instruments. Instrument theft can be crippling for indie musicians and bands as it can set them back by a lot of money. The MU believes that this shouldn't get in the way of musicians trying to make amazing music, which is why the MU membership includes a £2,000 instrument insurance cover.</p>
<h3>Campaigns</h3>
<p>The MU has always campaigned for their members' rights and they still do. One of the biggest concerns amongst music artists or anyone in the music industry with the Brexit situation is the uncertainty over the free movement of people.</p>
<p>Until now, the musicians were able to easily travel across Europe for tours with little to no hassle. Now, with so much uncertainty over the future movement of people, the Musicians' Union is lobbying for parliament to find an easy, seamless solution for musicians like a touring visa.</p>
<p>With free movement, it might put off many DIY artists from touring in other parts of Europe and prevent them from connecting to their fans from other countries.</p>
<p>Touring is essential for musicians as it is one of their main sources of income and it also opens up a whole new world for new audiences. Without easy movement, artists could have complexities with touring and meeting fans abroad.</p>
<p>Another common issue that has been affecting the music community is that of being asked to play for shows and gigs at pubs/venues for no pay. In response, the MU is encouraging the members to share their stories under the hashtag #WorkNotPlayMU, so that these bad practices reach more eyes. The MU advises you to fight for your right while also supporting you legally and assisting you going forward.</p>
<p>For artists at any level, the payment for your hard work and services is essential. Given the revenue and joy music brings to a venue, there is absolutely no excuse for not paying musicians for their time and energy.</p>
<p>Moreover, bullying, sexual harassment, discrimination, racism, and more, are regrettable issues that still persist and continue to affect professionals within the music industry. The MU is campaigning for the rights of every member. Together with the ISM, they've launched a code of practice to combat these serious issues within the music sector.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Musicians' Union Membership</h2>
<p>While the above-mentioned points were some of the ways being in MU would help you, the union will also benefit you by offering tons of other services.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Free copyright and property rights protection</li>
    <li>Subsidized heart assignment and protection</li>
    <li>Free personal liability insurance</li>
    <li>Free instrument insurance</li>
    <li>Expert career and business advice</li>
    <li>Free legal assistance</li>
    <li>Free/discounted entry to training courses, events, and workshops across the country</li>
</ul>
<h2>Musicians' Union for DIY artists</h2>
<p>If you're a DIY artist who is just starting out their musical career but you're not sure if committing to the MU is necessary, then you should remind yourself how much it would mean to safeguard your music and your career.</p>
<p>While you may get by without outside help, but the industry is unpredictable and doesn't play fair all the time. While the industry might not be all doom and gloom, but just as you'd go for home insurance, it seems to be a small piece to pay for protecting your hard work and livelihood.</p>
<p>If there is something that you think isn't going right in the industry, the MU will listen to you and change it. Whether it is a local issue or an issue that affects musicians globally and needs governmental intervention, the MU will support you and bring the change.</p>
<p>You would be joining a great community of fellow musicians with great skills and a will to help each other succeed. The MU consists of more than 30,000 members, which means the networking opportunities will open up several great possibilities and ideas.</p>
<p>When starting out, it is important to knock on every door. If you're interested in starting a band or you need to collaborate with others, the MU forum would be a great place to find like-minded musicians.</p>
