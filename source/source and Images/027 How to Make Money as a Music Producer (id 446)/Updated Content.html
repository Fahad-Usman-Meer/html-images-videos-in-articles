<p>As music has evolved over the years, the opportunities for music producers, musicians, and music artists are also continuing to grow with endless possibilities. Earlier, it was pretty hard to make money unless you have signed with a record label or have connections in the music industry.</p>
<p>However, things have drastically changed since then. The internet has become a gateway to countless opportunities and the prospect of the entire world being your audience.</p>
<p>Sending out demos to record labels while you wait for them to get back to you is no longer a thing. Going from one club to the other, begging owners to allow you to play a gig at their venues is also a practice of the older times. Things don’t work that way anymore. Moreover, it has become increasingly easy to make money today as a music producer.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, here are some of the best ways a music producer can make money in 2021.</p>

<h2 id="sell-royalty-free-music-or-beats">Sell royalty-free music or beats</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-sell-royalty-free-music-or-beats.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Sell royalty-free music or beats" alt="Sell royalty-free music or beats"></p>

<p>For the past few years, there seems to have been a surge of beatmakers and music producers who sell ‘type beats’ to independent rappers, singers, and artists. Most of them are earning loads of money selling beats and instrumentals on their site and other platforms while also using social media for marketing their digital products.</p>

<p>Beat prices can cost anywhere from $19 to upward of 100s of dollars depending on the quality of beat, how famous you are as a producer, and how big the client is.</p>

<p>Licensing types should also be considered when it comes to pricing your beats (non-exclusive vs. exclusive tears). However, there is no rule for this.</p>

<p>One of the best things about selling beats is the opportunity to earn while you sleep. You can make a beat in your spare time, sell it on your site, and leave it there and watch people buy your beats.</p>

<p>The best way of starting this would be to produce at least 15-20 beats to jump-start the business. This number is considered ideal if you’re beginning because it isn’t too overwhelming to produce and manage. The next thing would be to get a domain name for your site. There are a ton of options like GoDaddy, Hostgator, and Bluehost. Your domain name needs to be consistent with your brand.</p>

<p>Once you have done that, you need to hire someone who can create your beat logo or you could even make your own logo. You could outsource from freelancing sites like Fiverr, where you can get your logo made for five dollars or more.</p>

<p>The final step would be to choose the website hosting service. Here are a few top hosting services that you can pick from –</p>

<h3>Traktrain</h3>
<p>You can make money handsomely on Traktrain as there are thousands of aspiring artists looking for new beats daily. Moreover, the platform itself will not take any money from your sales.</p>

<h3>Beatstars</h3>
<p>One of the most popular beat-selling sites among producers, it comes with free and paid account options.</p>

<h3>Airbit</h3>
<p>Previously known as myFlashStore, Airbit is an online marketplace where you can interact with fellow music producers, sell beats, and make money.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-youtube-channel">Create a YouTube channel</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-create-a-youtube-channel.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Create a YouTube channel" alt="Create a YouTube channel"></p>

<p>Ever wondered how Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, and more got so big and started earning billions?</p>

<p>Many big music artists started their journey on YouTube, posting their music and cover videos. They had to churn out content day in, day out, to make a name for themselves and try to grow their fan base.</p>

<p>Uploading your beats and music on YouTube and creating an interactive channel with a consistent upload schedule will not just help you grow your portfolio, but it’ll also help your business while making you money.</p>

<p>On top of that, as a music producer, you can also post behind-the-scenes content or vlogs, which your viewers might like. You need to plan out the branding strategy and be unique to make sure you stand out from the rest.</p>

<p>You must start by regularly uploading content to quality for YouTube Partner Program. Your primary goal should be to reach 1,000 subs and 4,000 watch hours before you’re able to monetize your channel. Also, don’t forget to set up a Google AdSense account for withdrawing your future AdSense income.</p>

<h2 id="use-patreon-for-increasing-your-income-streams">Use Patreon for increasing your income streams</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-use-patreon-for-increasing-your-income-streams.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Use Patreon for increasing your income streams" alt="Use Patreon for increasing your income streams"></p>

<p>Patreon is a membership platform that provides tools for creators to run a subscription-based service, with the opportunities for artists to build relationships with subscribers and provide exclusive content to their subs or ‘patrons’.</p>

<p>This is like a secret fans club. Your patrons can subscribe to you for a certain fee in exchange for exclusive content that other subs don’t have access to.</p>

<p>You could post things that your subs might be interested in like customized music, vlogs, behind-the-scenes videos, or even personalized video chats. You must be creative and try to figure out how you can give a unique experience that your patrons will enjoy.</p>

<p>The most effective way of using Patreon would be to advertise it on your YouTube channel. You can easily paste the link in your videos while also giving your followers a heads up on other social media platforms.</p>

<h2 id="sell-sample-packs">Sell sample packs</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-sell-sample-packs.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Sell sample packs" alt="Sell sample packs"></p>

<p>When it comes to producing music, there are producers who are capable of producing their own synth riffs, tweak drum sounds, and effects, and more. However, there are also producers who cannot do this or don’t have time to do this.</p>

<p>They desperately need someone to give them the finished article.</p>

<p>If you’re someone who has a knack for sound design, then this could be the perfect way to make money. You can produce customized synth samples, drum kits, or even preset packs for VST’s like Sylenth, Serum, Massive, and more. You could sell these samples on your personal website but don’t forget to add artwork for making it more visually appealing.</p>

<p>Another great option would be to sell the packs through sample libraries. Here are a few popular ones –</p>

<h3>Splice sounds</h3>
<p>With more than two million royalty-free samples, MIDI files, and presets, this is one of the most popular options among music producers.</p>

<h3>ADSR sounds</h3>
<p>This website doesn’t just feature a huge variety of royalty-free samples but it also sells video courses for music production, which attracts the right target market.</p>

<p><img src="/img-temp/446-offer-expert-mixing-services.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Offer expert mixing services" alt="Offer expert mixing services"></p>

<p>Mixing is one of the most important steps before releasing music.</p>

<p>You may be wondering, ‘How many rappers, singers, and artists are releasing music on a frequent basis”? The answer – tons of them!</p>

<p>Having to book a high-end professional studio for this service would break the bank for most artists as they could be on a tight budget. If you think you have an ear for balancing the mix and making it the best version it could possibly be, take advantage of this opportunity and offer your expert services for an affordable price. The price should depend on the studio equipment, the number of tracks, the level of expertise, and other factors.</p>

<p>There are tons of mixing engineers who charge between $50 and $200 per song but this generally depends on individual preferences. Many professional studios charge higher but you could benefit from it by asking for a fair fee and giving exceptional services.</p>

<h2 id="get-work-on-freelancing-websites">Get work on freelancing websites</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-get-work-on-freelancing-websites.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Get work on freelancing websites" alt="Get work on freelancing websites"></p>

<p>Freelancing websites are generally seen as platforms that are only good for IT-related jobs and administrative work. While a majority of people on freelancing sites are looking for those services, there is also a huge market that music producers can take advantage of.</p>

<p>There are clients who need music for their short films, independently released apps or games, startup ads, and more.</p>

<p>If you are versatile enough and you’re willing to try out other audio-related tasks, there are tons of jobs out there like nursery rhymes compilation, custom song production, music content writing, podcast editing, and more.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most popular freelance websites on the internet –</p>

<h3>Fiverr</h3>
<p>One of the most popular websites for freelancers, Fiverr will allow you to offer services for as low as five dollars. When you’re starting out, you could offer cheap services for basic music gigs like creating a 20-30 second custom instrumental with an instrument or two.</p>

<p>Later, you could add an extra fee for longer pieces and additional work. However, you need to make sure that you offer premium services for what it is really worth.</p>

<h3>Upwork</h3>
<p>Previously known as oDesk, this freelancing site is one of the biggest and fastest-growing marketplaces that cater to millions of freelancers and clients around the world.</p>

<p>Because of the overwhelming number of applications, this platform is very selective when it comes to approving accounts. You need to make sure that you create an impressive profile and portfolio to get approved. Moreover, you also need to take the required tasks to increase your chances of getting hired.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/yKz_ZuNQg_Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="explore-music-licensing">Explore music licensing</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-explore-music-licensing.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Explore music licensing" alt="Explore music licensing"></p>

<p>Easily one of the most lucrative options to add to the list would be licensing music for TV shows and films.</p>

<p>So how does this work?</p>

<p>Basically, you will need to make instrumental cures or songs that have vocals, which would work well for TV shows or films, and pitch them to clients and wait until you’re signed to be a part of their catalog.</p>

<p>Your music needs to be really good if you want to succeed in this field. Networking and having some communication skills will come in handy as you’ll need to deal with supervisors and music library owners who would help you in getting sync placements.</p>

<p>There are many libraries ready to offer upfront sync payments from a few hundred dollars to several thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>The fees will be split equally between the composer and the library but there are some who don’t offer upfront payments. Despite that, the most exciting thing about music licensing will be the back-end income that will start kicking in once you start getting royalties. Just imagine making tracks that will be played on international shows with worldwide broadcast and re-runs.</p>

<h2 id="teach-music-lessons">Teach music lessons</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-teach-music-lessons.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Teach music lessons" alt="Teach music lessons"></p>

<p>Do you know how to play different instruments?</p>

<p>Whatever the instrument may be, you can use this talent to teach others and help them develop their music skills.</p>

<p>Depending on your preference, you could do it at your home studio or go to the students’ homes or via Skype.</p>

<p>Remember to advertise online using your personal website or Facebook ads or YouTube and look to target clients near you. For Skype lessons, you shouldn’t limit yourself and try to teach as many students as possible, even if they’re from other countries.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/urH4-vNoT2s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="put-your-music-on-streaming-sites-like-spotify-and-itunes">Put your music on streaming sites like Spotify and iTunes</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-put-your-music-on-streaming-sites-like-spotify-and-itunes.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Put your music on streaming sites like Spotify and iTunes" alt="Put your music on streaming sites like Spotify and iTunes"></p>

<p>Another great way of earning while you’re sleeping – streaming royalties.</p>

<p>If you’ve established yourself as a beatmaker, you could double that income by making music for your fan base.</p>

<p>This time, you will not be working behind the scenes, instead, you will be the main artist here.</p>

<p>For starters, you should take advantage of these music distribution services based on your needs –</p>

<h3>Distrokid</h3>
<p>For just $19.99 a year, you will be able to upload an unlimited number of songs and albums. Distrokid also has a unique automated system for royalty splits if you’re releasing songs as a collaboration with other artists.</p>

<h3>Tunecore</h3>
<p>Even though this distribution company does charge relatively more, they’re very transparent when it comes to earnings, analytics, and reports.</p>

<h2 id="sell-your-merchandise">Sell your merchandise</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/446-sell-your-merchandise.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Sell your merchandise" alt="Sell your merchandise"></p>

<p>
    Selling your merchandise is yet another smart way of making money. You can sell anything from caps and t-shirts to wristbands, key chains, coffee mugs, and more. It will be up to you, the possibilities are endless.
</p>
<p>This option involves some graphic designing work and you can either come up with your own designs or you could hire someone to do the job for you.</p>

<p>The designs need to be consistent with your brand. You will be using your brand logo for the most part but you can also throw in your tagline or a few catchphrases to improve the merchandise.</p>
