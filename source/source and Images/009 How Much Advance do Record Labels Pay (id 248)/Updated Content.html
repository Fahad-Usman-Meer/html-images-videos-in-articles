<p>One thing that temps most musicians into signing deals with record labels is the promise of an 'advance'. It is especially true for independent, up-and-coming acts who have spent a long time slogging through on their own dime and making several financial sacrifices in the process.</p>
<p>For many people, getting an advance is like a tempting opportunity to get rich.</p>
<p>But is it ever that simple?</p>
<p>The most important thing that you should remember is that an advance is basically just an advance. In simple terms, it is like a loan against royalties that you seek to earn on your future sales, and the record label requires a return of the advance.</p>
<p>In fact, the record labels will keep revenues until they are able to recoup the full amount of the advance, and this holds true across multiple singles, albums, and advances.</p>
<p>This is because record label advances are usually cross-collateralized, which means that a record label can pull money from the record sales or other band revenue streams in order to recoup its advance.</p>
<p>Now there's your warning about getting ahead of yourself and getting too excited about the prospect of advanced cash.</p>
<p>In this article, you will get to learn all about the advance payments from record labels, how much advance you can expect, how the advance is calculated, is it a smart choice, and a lot more.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-mean-by-an-advance">What do you mean by an 'advance'?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-what-do-you-mean-by-an-advance.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="What do you mean by an advance?" alt="What do you mean by an advance?"></p>
<p>The first thing that every independent, up-and-coming artist or band should realize is that an advance is just a payment that will need to be paid back to the record label. The money will have to be paid back or recouped out of your future earnings.</p>
<p>It is a loan, not a payment just for being good at music.</p>
<p>Any money that is given to you as 'advance' will be owed back to the record bale before they start giving you additional money from your royalties.</p>
<p>Not just that, in most cases, the record label will be entitled to make back its marketing and production costs before paying you any more money.</p>
<p>However, the good news for you is that in case your record fails to sell to expectations, you will not be responsible for paying back the advanced money because the advance is the record label's investment is a risk.</p>
<p>The record label is taking a risk or a chance on your success. This is why record labels are very careful when it comes to deciding whom to sign and whom to not sign.</p>
<p>Likewise, you should also look carefully at all the potential contracts on the table and look for the best deal available. These days, the '360 deals' are the most in-demand deals that give the label profits from all streams of revenue.</p>

<p>If you feel like you have hit a wall in terms of your capacity to invest in music, you might need to ready capital that only a record label can provide.</p>
<p>If you have better equipment at your disposal, it could take your song recording and music quality up a notch, perhaps even several.</p>
<p>In case you don't have enough money, time, or resources to organize a tour, especially one that'll take you across the country or even abroad, signing a deal with a record label can set it up for you and help you greatly in your career.</p>
<p>When producing a new album, the cost to master, print copies, and distribute might be out of your reach. A record label has the funds, network, and staff to make all of that happen. A reputed record label will have better resources and expertise. However, no one will care for your music as much as you will.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be on you to keep track of how things should go and speak up if the work isn't being done the way you want it to be done.</p>

<h2 id="when-can-an-advance-turn-out-to-be-a-bad-idea">When can an advance turn out to be a bad idea?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-when-can-an-advance-turn-out-to-be-a-bad-idea.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="When can an advance turn out to be a bad idea?" alt="When can an advance turn out to be a bad idea?"></p>
<p>Always have a professional or an expert look over the recording deals before signing them. Not only will your advance come out of your future profits, but the label will be legally allowed to recoup its investments.</p>
<p>This essentially means that they can legally pay themselves back for production, distribution, and marketing costs before any of the royalties made from the album lands in your bank account.</p>
<p>You must pay close attention to the terms of any recoup clauses present in the potential contract.</p>
<p>Many unwary artists might not see any money after getting the advance for several years after signing the contract. You should consider asking for a cap on the recoup or limited the money that the record label can claim under this clause.</p>
<p>Another important thing that you need to watch out for is the control that the record label can have over whether your music is 'marketable' enough or not.</p>
<p>In case the deal requires you to produce a set number of songs or albums per year, the record label could decide that you aren't honoring your contract and never declare your advance (loan) to be paid back.</p>
<p>These types of things are often employed by larger record labels, as independent labels tend to be a lot more upfront about their terms.</p>
<p>You need to remember that at the end of the day, a record label is a business, and their primary job is to make money. It is your job as an artist or a band to look out for yourself and seek advice from knowledgeable industry professionals.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-advance-can-you-expect">How much advance can you expect?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-how-much-advance-can-you-expect.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How much advance can you expect?" alt="How much advance can you expect?"></p>
<p>Generally, advances are based on the expected sales.</p>
<p>Since no one will know how much your music will sell until the record label actually distributes your music, so the advance will depend on the label's educated guess.</p>
<p>Based on their knowledge of the market and how well you have sold in the past (if you have released albums before), the record label will decide exactly how much one you can be given upfront.</p>
<p>An advance for a relatively unknown artist without a track record could run around $500 – $2,500 for a single and $2,500 - $7,500 for EPs. You must remember that unless you have had a proven record of selling thousands of records, your advance is highly unlikely to be any larger.</p>
<p>Moreover, you should know that large advances even be compensation for less ideal terms elsewhere in the record dal.</p>
<p>So what can you do in this situation?</p>
<p>Make sure to remember all the pros and cons of accepting the record label advance and consider all the aspects such as retaining master rights, being able to have your say in decision-making, and more.</p>
<p>Always look for ways to keep control of your music as it could be more profitable than an advance in the long-term. Avoid spending all your money right away if you've got a bigger advance than expected.</p>

<h2>How is the advance calculated?</h2>
<h2 id="how-is-the-advance-calculated">How is the advance calculated?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-how-is-the-advance-calculated.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How is the advance calculated?" alt="How is the advance calculated?"></p>
<p>For most record labels, the process to determine the advance is part science and part art.</p>
<p>With the first advance, the advance payment for the first album that you're going to record with the record label as part of a multi-album deal or for the only album deal, the label is going to consider many different factors including your previous record or their estimate of the market.</p>
<p>Indie labels, in particular, are going to consider how much they can afford to pay you while still having enough cash left for marketing and promoting the album release.</p>
<p>If you're working with an indie record label, you need to opt for a small advance in exchange for a relatively bigger promo spend as it'll be the right choice in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="a-record-labels-considerations">A record label's considerations</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-a-record-labels-considerations.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="A record labels considerations" alt="A record labels considerations"></p>
<p>Major record labels will consider things such as how much they can afford to spend on promotion in comparison to how many copies they feel they can sell off your next release in order to recoup the advance and make extra money.</p>
<p>Of course, indie record labels will also consider sales potential, but for the majority of them, it is a cash flow issue. Even if they feel like they can easily sell millions, they cannot pay you a huge advance to cover that.</p>
<p>This is where art comes in. Record labels will consider your sales potential, usually based on what you have accomplished in the past, as well as make plans for touring, feedback on your music, and a lot more.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the day, it is still a gamble because they don't actually know if the advance is going to be too big or too small or just right. You should expect them to tread the path of caution, though, unless you happen to be the subject of an intense bidding war.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/w7IY5JgM77M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="advances-involved-in-multi-album-deals">Advances involved in multi-album deals</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-advances-involved-in-multi-album-deals.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Advances involved in multi-album deals" alt="Advances involved in multi-album deals"></p>
<p>The science will come into play here, particularly with the advance formula that is associated with multi-album record deals. These formulas will not be included in the record labels but if you are signing with a major record label, a competent lawyer will insist that your contract should include one.</p>
<p>Essentially, a mathematical equation will be used to determine the advance for each album in the multi-album deal. The equation will set the advance as a percentage of royalties earned on your previous albums. Moreover, there is a minimum and maximum payout amount that is stipulated in the formula.</p>
<p>The exact percentage will be computed using sales from within the specified territory during a specified period (for instance, sales in the US for nine months after the album's release).</p>
<p>Once it is determined, the formula will be applied to each release, which means two sales will determine album three's advance, the third album's royalties will determine the fourth album's advance, and so on.</p>
<p>The beauty of this equation is that it'll reward good sales while preventing overdoing advances if the sales drop.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-risks-and-make-a-wise-decision">Understand the risks and make a wise decision</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/428-understand-the-risks-and-make-a-wise-decision.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Understand the risks and make a wise decision" alt="Understand the risks and make a wise decision"></p>
<p>Record labels will take calculated risks. But it doesn't mean that they will not make mistakes. Their risks might not pay off and the artists or bands that they sign could flop.</p>
<p>However, that is actually not a problem because if they cannot recoup the costs through sales and streams, they will find other ways to get their money back.</p>
<p>An advance is basically a vote of confidence from the record label. It isn't the label saying "yes, you have made it, you are already a success". Instead, it is the record label having confidence in you and saying "we feel you can do well and we are willing to take a chance on you".</p>
<p>Again, it is a calculated risk as no record label will consider an artist with no potential to begin with.</p>
<p>An advance isn't actually free money. It is more like a loan that you'll need to repay in the future.</p>
<p>There are risks to getting an advance no matter how you look it. Yes, you may have a great chance at mainstream success and it isn't beyond the realm of possibilities that you have what the market is looking for, but there is also a chance that you might fail. Even if you're great in every regard, you shouldn't assume that you will succeed at all costs.</p>
<p>You should take an advance only if you're happy with the contract that you have been offered. However, you should also be aware of what could happen in case the label isn't able to recoup the costs.</p>
<p>It will be painful for you as you'll not only lose your signed status but you'll also owe them a lot of money. This could be a huge setback that some artists might not be able to recover from.</p>
<p>For many music artists, being courted by a record label spells success but that isn't necessarily the case with everyone. If you feel like signing to a record label may be the best move for you, take the help of a lawyer and go through the terms and details.</p>
