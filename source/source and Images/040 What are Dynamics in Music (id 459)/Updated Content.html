<p>Throughout its history, dynamics has been an important expressive element of music. Simply put, dynamics are the differences in loudness and quietness in a piece of music. It is the relative volume of a note or section of a musical composition.</p>

<p>Dynamics operate in two ways. The first is successive, exemplified by crescendos, diminuendos, or sudden contrasts in loud (forte) and quiet (piano). The second is simultaneity, meaning the balance between parts of a chord, instrument, or voice when considered as a combination.</p>

<p>Dynamic range is the difference between a sound's loudest and quietest moments, and it is that dynamic range that gets manipulated whether by instructions to the performer or by processing by a mix engineer.</p>

<p>The best way to illustrate what dynamics are is to recall that the instrument we know as the Piano was originally named the <i>Pianoforte</i> because, unlike other keyboard instruments at the time of its invention, the Piano could produce a dynamic range of loud and soft sounds.</p>

<p>This article will take us through the science of musical dynamics, the history of its use in musical scores, examples of dynamics in action, as well as modern techniques used to control dynamics with studio technology in the present-day.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-dynamic-notation">History of Dynamic Notation</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-history-of-dynamic-notation.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="History of Dynamic Notation" alt="History of Dynamic Notation"></p>

<p>Instructions for dynamics first appeared in the early 16th century. Lute music was the first to receive dynamic markings, but it wasn’t until the 17th century, when the Italian terms <i>piano</i> and <i>forte</i> came into prominent use, that these markings became common attributes of a music score.</p>

<p>Since the Baroque period, it has been common in the western classical tradition to indicate through notation a composer's wishes about the variations in the sound and volume of the elements of a piece of music. But it has also been understood that these nuances, within reason, fall within the responsibilities of the performer to execute.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-markings">Dynamic Markings</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-dynamic-markings.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Dynamic Markings" alt="Dynamic Markings"></p>

<p>Dynamics are so important and natural in music that it is something that exists whether or not there are formal markings for it. This makes it important to make a distinction between dynamic variation and dynamic markings. The fewer the markings, as was often the case with Baroque music and also with today's popular music recorded in a studio, the greater the responsibility of the performer (or producer) for making decisions on variations of sound within the piece.</p>

<p>Dynamic markings are not objective nor are they always offered. Instead of specifying volume levels in an absolute sense, dynamics are relative. They require the discretion and interpretation of the performer and an understanding of the context in which the dynamic marking is made. For example, a quiet marking in one section might mean something different than a quiet marking in another depending on the loudness of the music surrounding it.</p>

<p>In the classical tradition, dynamics are indicated using Italian words, although many musicians use the equivalent words for loudness and quietness in their own language.</p>

<p>The main level markings are as follows:</p>

<p>
    <i>Piano (p)</i> = soft<br />
    <i>Forte (f)</i> = loud
</p>

<p>There are varying degrees of softness and loudness and they are represented by the following scale of markings from loudest to softest:</p>

<p>
    <i>Fortississimo (fff)</i> = very very loud<br />
    <i>Fortissimo (ff)</i> = very loud<br />
    <i>Forte (f)</i> = loud<br />
    <i>Mezzo-forte (mf)</i> = moderatly loud<br />
    <i>Mezzo-piano (mp)</i> = moderately soft<br />
    <i>Piano (p)</i> = quiet<br />
    <i>Pianissimo (pp)</i> = very quiet<br />
    <i>Pianississimo (ppp)</i> = very very quiet
</p>

<p>Additionally, two other markings indicate a relative quietening or loudening of notes relative to the notes around them:</p>

<p>
    <i>Più piano (più p)</i> = more quiet<br />
    <i>Più forte (più f)</i> = more loud
</p>

<p>There are some uses of dynamic markings that go beyond the normal range of <i>ppp</i> and <i>fff</i>, these are called ‘extreme dynamic markings’ and are meant to express a range of loudness and softness beyond the normal range. This is a technique that was mainly employed by the orchestras and composers of the late 19th century when larger orchestral sections were required to mount heavy attacks of, for example, brass instruments, by having them all play loudly and at once. Thus we have examples of <i>ffff</i> (4 fs), <i>fffff</i> (5 fs) all the way up to <i>ffffffff</i> (8fs), and similarly with piano <i>pppp</i> (4 ps) all the way up to <i>pppppppp</i> (8 ps).</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-changes.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Changes" alt="Changes"></p>

<p>The dynamic markings listed above speak of a change in relative volume, but they do not indicate the speed at which that volume is to change. Is the change to happen gradually, and if so is it increasing or decreasing? Or is the change to happen suddenly, and if so with how much force?</p>

<p>For these instances, we need markings of change, and they come in the following forms:</p>

<p>
    <i>crescendo (cresc.)</i> = growing<br />
    <i>decrescendo (decresc.)</i> = decreasing<br />
    <i>diminuendo (dim.)</i> = diminishing
</p>

<p> ‘Hairpin’ symbols, written below the staff, are also used to represent these concepts. An open angle (<) indicates a gradual increase in loudness. A closed-angle (>) indicates a gradual softening. If the two symbols are placed side by side (<>) this means that the music is to become gradually stronger and then become gradually softer. Generally, these symbols are used to indicate dynamic changes over a few bars of music, while the cres., decresc., and dim. listed above are saved for changes that occur over a longer period of time in the music.</p>

<p>Combined with accents, which similarly emphasize momentary rhythmic or melodic details, dynamics has been one of the keys to successful musical performance, particularly in the realm of classical music, but also in Jazz and other forms as well. Without an understanding of dynamics, it would be impossible for an ensemble to play a piece of music together and have it sound cohesive. As well, the transition and exchange of music between orchestras, for example, relies on this mutual understanding and implementation of dynamics.</p>

<p>With the advent of modern recording technology, alternative ways to control the dynamic range of music have been developed, and it is to this we now turn our attention.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-range-in-music-production">Dynamic Range in Music Production</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-dynamic-range-in-music-production.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Dynamic Range in Music Production" alt="Dynamic Range in Music Production"></p>

<p>Dynamics in modern music relies on sound and studio technology instead of the various orchestral techniques we talked about above. Studio technology allows for some of the same kinds of effects, the creating and releasing of tension, the dynamics of volume in music, but it adds to this the element of spatial effects. These are achieved in an entirely different way. The way dynamics is achieved in modern studio settings is through mixing and production. Dynamics processors, such as compressors, use mathematical processes to affect the sound.</p>

<p>Like the dynamics markings above, these processors change the volume of any given sound, and they get their names from what they are doing to the dynamics of the track. Let's take a look at the four processors that affect the dynamic range in a modern studio setting: Compressors, Limiters, Expanders, and Gates.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/_hRE2RKUV2E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="compressors">Compressors</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-compressors.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Compressors" alt="Compressors"></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly compressors compress the sound. But what does that mean? They make the quieter and louder parts closer to each other in the level thus narrowing the dynamic range between the two extremes.</p>

<p>Downward compression reduces the force of the signal when it becomes too loud. Whereas upward compression gives the signal a boost until it reaches the desired level.</p>

<p>There are six parameters available in the average compressor and they are listed below.</p>

<p><b>Threshold:</b> turns on the compressor when it reaches a certain threshold (measured in dB) of loudness (downward compression) or softness (upward compression).</p>

<p><b>Ratio: </b> controls how much compression occurs.</p>

<p><b>Knee: </b> affects how signals near and around the threshold point will be compressed. A ‘hard’ knee will turn on compression immediately upon crossing the threshold, even if that is just 0.1 dB above the set limit. A ‘soft’ knee on the other hand rounds the sound before it crosses the threshold giving it a smoother sound.</p>

<p><b>Attack time: </b> regulates the speed (measured in ms) at which the compressor reacts upon the threshold being reached; the amount of time it will take for the compressor to go from no compression to full compression.</p>

<p><b>Release time: </b> controls the length of time it takes for full compression to release the compression and arrive at zero compression.</p>

<p><b>Makeup gain: </b> since compressors minimize the levels of the loudest signals, you end up with a signal that is quieter than the original. Makeup gain compensates for this by amplifying the output signal, bringing the loud parts back to the level they were at in the original.</p>

<p>Compression is used for controlling sound dynamics in many different ways. But basically, producers and mix engineers use compressors to make the sound less dynamic, less natural-sounding, by making the different sounds in a recording, or live performance, more consistent, more level with each other.</p>

<h2 id="limiters">Limiters</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-limiters.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Limiters" alt="Limiters"></p>

<p>Limiters set a threshold that a sound signal cannot pass. When this threshold is reached it will be immediately compressed so as not to go beyond it. Basically, a limiter is a type of compressor that has a very high ratio. Some limiters have adjustable threshold levels, some do not. Limiters are used in mastering to bring the track up to a commercial standard, gluing the various elements of the track together and making them louder on the same level. Limiters are also used for live music, ensuring that extremely loud sounds are controlled.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/h5YcPQYjueU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="expanders">Expanders</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-expanders.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Expanders" alt="Expanders"></p>

<p>In many ways, expanders are the opposite of compressors. If a compressor is responsible for compressing dynamics, and a limiter is responsible for limiting it, then an expander is responsible for expanding the dynamic range of recorded audio. This means that the louder parts and quieter parts will become louder and quieter relative to each other. An expander is used to <i>increase</i> and widen the dynamic range, making for a more organic sound.</p>

<p>Upward expansion amplifies the signal level that passes the threshold ceiling, and a downward expander reduces any signal that goes below the set threshold, rather than increase it like an upward compressor would. The functions of an expander are basically the same as those found in compressors. Thresholds determine input levels that will activate the expander. When a signal is loud or soft enough to cross this threshold the expander will kick in. Similarly, knee, attack, and release times work the same as in a compressor, just in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Makeup gain is not necessary for downward expansion because the quiet parts will simply be quieter, but with upward expansion they are necessary. In upward expansion, as a signal becomes expanded louder, distortion can occur. The makeup gain will reduce the force of that signal, and return the louder parts to their original levels.</p>

<h2 id="gates">Gates</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/459-gates.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Gates" alt="Gates"></p>

<p>Our last dynamic processor is an extreme form of downward expansion with a high ratio. Gates give us a floor level threshold that will allow us to automatically mute certain parts of the audio signal. Gates will help remove background noises from a track and tighten up the sound of drums by aiding the isolation of individual drum sounds from a set.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Dynamics are a huge component of all types of music. The loudness and quietness of the individual sounds in a musical performance is as much a part of the composition as the notes themselves. How performers are to interpret dynamic range in any given piece is something that has been specified for hundreds of years by various systems of notation. In the era of recorded music or live performances channeled through a soundboard, it is the job of the mixer to attenuate or accentuate the various sounds in the dynamic range based on what sounds best. The science of dynamics is large and nuanced, impossible to cover in such a short article, but I hope this has given you a picture of some of the basic ways it functions.</p>
