<p><img src="/img-temp/463-before-you-start-selling-your-merchandise.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Before you start selling your merchandise" alt="Before you start selling your merchandise"></p>
<p>Make sure you check off these three key things before you start selling your merch –</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure that your logo and branding are finished. The last thing you'd want is to have something that you don't like being associated with you and plastered on you everywhere you go.</li>
    <li>Make sure that you choose the right kind of merchandise for your fans. For example, crowds of young girls screaming on top of their lungs at your concerts will devour tote bags, glasses, and bracelets. But men in their 40? Not so much.</li>
    <li>You can easily find what your fanbase likes by putting up an Instagram poll or interacting with them during your gigs.</li>
    <li>Make sure that you research venues before to see if they have enough space for you to sell your merch. If they allow, you must ask them how much room you'll have to work with.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-start-your-own-merchandise-line">How to start your own merchandise line?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/463-how-to-start-your-own-merchandise-line.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How to start your own merchandise line?" alt="How to start your own merchandise line?"></p>
<p>First, you need to research and ask your fans the kind of merchandise they'd love to have and found find the most useful. You could put up a little survey on your social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or YouTube and see the kind of merchandise your fans would prefer to buy. Then, you can also research merchandise options by other artists and bands and see what sells the best.</p>
<p>Once you've got a decent understanding of the best merchandise options, you can be original and bring your creativity to get ideas that haven't been done before. You need to get original and create your own brand logo and design. Moreover, try to be as creative as possible and think of something that would represent your style of music and your brand the best.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/zkzZGGUA65Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="how-do-design-and-make-your-merchandise">How do design and make your merchandise?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/463-how-do-design-and-make-your-merchandise.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How do design and make your merchandise?" alt="How do design and make your merchandise?"></p>
<p>First, you should make sure that you establish a budget before deciding on the design and type of merchandise. One of the best ideas would be to draw a table and write down on one side the options and on the other side mention the budget. This simple technique will allow you to easily spread the budget while deciding on the style and type of merchandise you can go for.</p>
<p>Another way to make the most of your budget would be to track what you're spending and how much of it you have left. After you've considered the budget, you can start thinking of the companies that specialize in specific types of merchandise. A great idea would be to ask other musicians which companies they ordered merchandise from and which companies they'd recommend to you.</p>
<p>Before you design your merchandise, you'll need to consider the styles and colors that best reflect your brand. You can even choose a catchy sentence or song title that reminds your fans of your music. You could either design your own merchandise or get a professional to design it for you. By using software like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop but also other resources like Inscape and GIMP. Once you've found the design of your merch, you can send it to your supplier and get it designed.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-merchandise-should-you-get-made">How much merchandise should you get made?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/463-how-much-merchandise-should-you-get-made.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How much merchandise should you get made?" alt="How much merchandise should you get made?"></p>
<p>The best option would be to buy a package that includes price discounts and exciting offers.</p>
<p>For example, if you're getting 50 business cards for free if you buy 150 cards, then it would be best to buy 150 cards instead of just 100. As for the amount of merchandise you should order, that will depend on the number of fans you have and what package will be best for your savings.</p>
<p>The more you order, the cheaper it is likely to be. Moreover, it is important that you should make sure to order your merchandise well in advance so that the price stays cheap.</p>

<h2 id="how-should-you-sell-your-merchandise-offline">How should you sell your merchandise offline?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/463-how-should-you-sell-your-merchandise-offline.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How should you sell your merchandise offline?" alt="How should you sell your merchandise offline?"></p>
<p>The best way of selling your merchandise would be on tour during a gig. By purchasing your T-shirts or CDs, your fans will also be more than likely to share and contribute to your success.</p>
<p>However, the only drawback would be you either carry too little stock that gets sold out quickly or you pack too much stock and have to carry most of it back.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Wc2AXhILsv8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="how-to-sell-your-merchandise-online">How to sell your merchandise online?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/463-how-to-sell-your-merchandise-online.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How to sell your merchandise online?" alt="How to sell your merchandise online?"></p>
<p>There would be several more options to sell your merchandise online. You can even allow your fans to model and design the product and make it a more interactive process.</p>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>When selling your merch on your website, you need to make sure that the page is organized as it will help the fans know what they're buying.</p>

<p>The best choice would be to have an image of each item and a simple buy button underneath each item. You could also describe the items with a short note on the story behind them and who designed them. Also, remember to create category sections that include T-shirts, CDs, posters, and other accessories.</p>

<p>Thoroughly think of the site's design and use of colors for the background.</p>

<p>Moreover, make sure to add digital options like tracks, sheet music, eBooks, and more, which will be useful for your fans and easy to purchase.</p>

<p>It is important to change the merchandise regularly by adding new items, clearing out old items, holding sales, offering discount codes to fans in the mailing list, and more.</p>

<p>Another great way of interacting with your fans would be to run a giveaway contest. For instance, you can ask your fans to send some creative designs and the one who sends the best artwork will win free merchandise.</p>

<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>One of the ways of promoting your merch on YouTube would be to select two items that best reflect your brand and add value to your channel. Moreover, you can ask your fans about what kind of merch they'd like to buy from you.</p>

<p>You can even think of a promotion plan before, during, or after the merch launch. Make sure that you're using an approved merchandise site where you can easily link the merchandise.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/9N8cxzBMgnk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="how-much-should-you-charge-for-the-merchandise">How much should you charge for the merchandise?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/463-how-much-should-you-charge-for-the-merchandise.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How much should you charge for the merchandise?" alt="How much should you charge for the merchandise?"></p>
<p>The recommended markup (i.e. the ratio between the cost of the product and its selling price) should be between 20% and 25%. The average price for a T-shirt or sweater should usually be around $25 to $30. CDs are generally priced around $7 to $10. As for posters, they cost around $15 while USB sticks with videos, albums, and bonuses cost around $15.</p>
<h3>Profit is key</h3>
<p>Obviously, you need to make a profit on each merchandise sold, but pricing could make or break your sales. For the majority of fans, buying merch is an impulse-buy, so pricing will affect their decision-making.</p>
<p>In fact, 8 of the 10 best-selling shirts sold on Spotify were under $25. Moreover, fans are likely to buy T-shirts $25 twice as often as t-shirts that cost more than $25. And don't just limit it to t-shirts, for every product, there is an optimal price range so you should come up with a price that isn't too high and it still gets you a decent profit.</p>
<p>Give special deals and have flash sales</p>
<p>Having deals that offer discounted products will be a great way of getting more sales.</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 T-shirts + 1 Free music download</li>
    <li>Buy 2 get one free</li>
    <li>1 T-shirt + 1 CD for $30</li>
</ul>
<p>While it might sound obvious but make sure that you're still making a decent profit when choosing what deals and discounts to give. It can be easy to lose track of the actual cost when you're deciding the bundle, so make sure that you have a price list with you such that both you and your fans can know the price.</p>
<h3>Experiment with the price</h3>
<p>Experimentation is a good strategy to start with. Test out a few prices of the merchandise by experimenting with different pricing and different package deals.</p>
<p>Make sure that you test each price for a decent period of time (at least 4-5 weeks) and not just a few days. This way, you will have adequate data to back up your optimal pricing strategy.</p>
<h3>Shipping costs</h3>
<p>The shipping cost is one of the biggest factors for online consumer purchasing decisions.  It is recommended that you should keep the shipping price as low as possible and don't go above $5. Anything above $5 can decrease your sales by an average of 20%.</p>
<p>The merch you sell at your show does not have to be the exact merchandise available on your website. Don't go for unrealistic products. Even though having a duvet with your name on it might seem pretty cool, but not many people are going to buy such products. Moreover, it is unlikely to fit a duvet into merch stalls.</p>
