<p>Every year critics claim that Rock Music is dead. But, with the arrival of many youngsters who are aiming to create more music and sing more, the news about the death of Rock music seems just hype by the media.</p>

<p>You must have gone through several headlines like "Rock music is dead: Thank God!". But, year after year, the development of Rock Music and the attachment of the next generation of people with Rock Music make the conclusion wrong.</p>

<p>When the media claims that Rock music is dead, their single claim centers on the discussion about classic artists. Well, the truth is that the artists are not going to get any younger. In addition to this, the same artist won't be around forever. The next conversation by media centers on the current rock acts that can draw a crowd. No doubt there are new age and hopeful stars that are capable of filling their arenas. For example, bands like Queens of the Stone Age and Twenty One Pilots are working for rock music. But, it is still a question of speculation whether they will ever reach the heights of the famous rock band or not.</p>

<h2>Expert opinion about the Rock Music</h2>
<p>Most often in a discussion like this, many experts like to get involved. They try to add their spicy opinions and thoughts on the topic. They also try to add weight to the discussion. Then, some musicians step in to explain how rock bands are playing the same song and music with the same old riffs. They also opine that the young bands and artists can change the course of the ship and they can steer away from the looming iceberg.</p>

<p>In the year 2017, the world of music changed. As per a study by Nielsen, there was a conclusion that said that Hip-hop and R&B were the most consumed and loved audio/video streams. It was also said that other genres like R&B overtook the position of Rock music. The study took into factor the album sales, downloads, audio, and video streams as well as other factors related to the popularity of other music Vs Rock music. One of the worst outcomes of the survey was that the popularity of other genres was cited as one of the main reasons for the rise in demand for streaming services in the United States.</p>

<p>People should be amazed that Metallica was the best-performing Rock artist in 2017. It was the same year when people said that Rock Music is dead. People who say that Rock Music is dead should know that Michael Jackson still holds the top position and has a record for the biggest selling of non-compilation albums of all time. It has the highest of almost 66 million in total sales. In addition to this, his other albums have also exceeded more than 40 million sales. Some of the biggest hits include Eagles, Meat Loaf's Bat out of Hell, and Rumors by Fleetwood.</p>


<h2>Deep information</h2>
<p>Every rock-specific album was released in the 70s. Thus, rock albums and music have been on the rack for more than 40-years. With the less number of record sales each year and the charts with streaming and radio play, things started to look a bit gloomy for Rock Music. But, many data and facts suggest that the old dog's heart is still beating with the same rock-solid rhythm.</p>

<p>For example, take the example of Imagine Dragons. In the year 2018, the Las-Vegas based Quartet became the first band to occupy the top four spots on the Billboard's Hot Rock songs. The most recently released single, "Natural" entered the Billboard's chart at Number 4 position. In addition to this, all singles from the album Evolve have spent 29 weeks at the Number one position in the chart.</p>

<p>There has been a slow-burning path to success for many rock artists. For example, the band was created when Dan Reynolds met the famous drummer Andrew Tolman and the pair hooked up with the lead guitarists Wayne Sermon and bassist Ben Mckee to release a trio of EPs. It wasn't till the year 2014 that electro-rockers gained prominence and popularity. But, they won the Grammy for the Best Rock performance after their breakthrough hit named "Radioactive". The band spent more than 18-months hovering at different positions on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<p>Rock music always has one foot into the world of synthesizers. In addition to this, Rock musicians and artists also have an urge to explore a radio-friendly sound. Bon Jovi was a famous Rock artist who troubled the top end of the singles chart in the 80s. Another one named U2 was also never afraid of experimenting with the synthesis-centric pop sound. The path of Rock Music can be even traced back to the popularity of the Beatles. The influence and the popularity of The Beatles knew no bounds.</p>

<p>No matter if you want to call Imagine Dragons hybrid Rock or not, but the music has taken them to arenas all around the world. The music by Imagine Dragons still has the ability to connect with the listeners on an intimate and personal level. Thus, the relativity of rock music that people still love.</p>

<h2>Special year with the shakedown</h2>
<p>For rockers with extra grit, Tyler Bryant and the period of mid-2000s can be called an ear of Rock music's greatest savior. In that era, Bryant and his gang had the pedigree as well as the career trajectory. They also had staying power.</p>

<p>Bryant always knew that he was made for the greatness of Rock. He had picked up the guitar at the age of six and he learnt from mentors like Roosevelt Twitty. Everyone knows about the popularity of Shakedown. The band was formed when Bryant was just 17. The band made their fan-base by the old method of relentless touring. So, this is the band that aligns itself with the greatness of Rock and has the courage to ride along.</p>

<h2>Born to do it</h2>
<p>If commercial sensibility is a parameter for greatness, there are many who have the flair for writing naturally. One such person is called Jaren Johnston. He has been penning down singles for many country superstars like Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, and Jake Owen. Jaren is a son of a musician who was a drummer in the 80s group Bandana. Thus, you can say that he was born into music.</p>

<p>
    Career for Johnston began with the band American Bang. Then he was signed by Warners. The group got moderate success with two albums and a single called "Wild and Young".
    When the group broke apart. Johnston got along with his high-school mates and fellow band member Kelby Ray and Neil Mason. Together they formed the band Cadillac Three.
    With two high-level songwriters, Mason's credit included lots of tracks for Jake Owen, Kelly Clarkson, and Rascal Flatts. The music began to gain attention and it started flowing.
    For the team Cadillac Three, the country music and the Southern Rock fitted together very well. For them, it was like a foot in a cowboy boot. The result of the band music was amazing. People called it "the whiskey-on-the-porch vibes.
</p>

<p>The feelings permeated through their songs like storytelling. Listening to the band Cadillac is like pulling an old pair of jeans. The stape style of the Rock has been persistent with the band for decades and it's so amazingly comfortable.</p>

<p>The Cadillac three plays back-to-back gigs while crossing the Atlantic ocean. In the year 2015, they played in a show on Friday and they went off to the UK, to sing a slot on Saturday. Again they were back in the US for another Music festival on Sunday.</p>

<p>We won't say that they are reinventing the Rock. The honesty and personality in their music will give you a feel and vibe of Rock. The way the band connects with the fans is amazing. All members of the band wear their hearts in sleeves and they make sure that audiences have the best time with them.</p>

<p>Their latest album named "Legacy" is approaching a high level in terms of music. As many people suggest this is the kind of music they will leave behind for generations to come. With two songwriters in the band, the Cadillac three are working to the best of their output. The way the Cadillac Three is churning out one album after another and the way they are smashing one hit after the other sky will be a limit for them.</p>

<p>When whiskey goes in one hand and southern rock in the other, anyone can have the heavenly moment. A musician named Rick Moss thought that his career in music was over. One of his bandmates struggled with alcohol addiction. But, once you are bitten by the bug called Rock n roll, it can be a hard feeling to shake.</p>

<p>After four years of struggle and grief, Moss formed the famous Stone Broken in the year 2013. He wrote the first song with his new bandmates Chris Davis, Kieron Conroy and Robyn Haycock. The song was called "The Life". The song was all about using what good you have as using it moves the vehicle of life forward.</p>

<p>
    Moss believes that all of us just have one shot at life. The band members are more mature and they come up with a deeper level of understanding about the industry. They believe as a group that in this highly competitive industry, there is no space for half-measures.
    After the release of their debut album named "All in Time" rock radio stations were falling for Stone Broke's anthem hard rock music and big riffs and bigger choruses.
</p>

<p>The Cadillac three struggled to get on radio play, the Stone Broken on the other hand was primed for the radio play. So, the commercial success of the Stone Broken band shows that hard rock bands are unashamed to flirt with the commercial success as well as appeal.</p>

<h2>Bottom line: Is Rock Music dead?</h2>
<p>Well, personally a music genre like Rock can't die. No matter the present generation may see Imagine Dragons as a bit annoying. But, innovations are coming on to the hallowed halls of Rock Music.</p>

<p>With the sale of albums witnessing a decline, people opine that no one will be able to break the record of Michael Jackson's accolade of biggest-sale of all time. When it comes to radio play genres like Hip-Hop and R&B can have a day for sure. But, when it comes to the live music arena, no one can get the reign of Rock Music.</p>

<p>The best part about Rock music is that it is a great survivor. It has seen the best phase as well as the worst phase. It has seen changes in the trends for more than seven decades.</p>
<p>Legends are not born overnight. There was a world before the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Black Sabbath. All these bands gained popularity and reputation only after producing amazing music and dedication towards the fan base. Rock music has an enduring and never-ending appeal.</p>

<p>Rock music thrives on the spirit of cultural trends. Well, you should know if Rock music is dead or not. Do you feel there is any other music genre about which we will talk in 2030? If not, Rock Music is certainly going to stay.</p>

<p>Many bands are revamping themselves. No doubt Rock Music has lost its biggest legends and many artists have died over the years. But, the relevance of Rock music lies in the sense that we are discussing it today.</p>

<p>
    Someday, somewhere, at some point in time, we will pick up our dad's or granddad's telecaster and we will try to know about their feelings onto the strings. At that time, we will be in a position to speak if Rock Music is dead or not.
    For now, the music is still rocking and it is touching the hearts of millions of people all around the world.
