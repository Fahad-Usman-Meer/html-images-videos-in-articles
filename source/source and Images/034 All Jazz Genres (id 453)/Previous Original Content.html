<p>
    Jazz began emerging from African-American communities in New Orleans in the late 19th century. Jazz's roots are found in ragtime and the blues which began blending with other musical forms into the New Orleans jazz bands of the 20th century.
</p>
<p>Jazz has always been tough to define because its development, which continues to this day, has spanned over 100 years, and has encompassed a wide range of musical sensibilities during that time. From ragtime through to hard-bop and onward through rock-fusion and contemporary electronic styles, Jazz has had only a few anchors that make it a cohesive musical style. </p>

<p>There have been many attempts to explain Jazz's defining features over the years. Most notably Joachim-Ernst Brendt and Travis Jackson have argued that Jazz has certain qualities throughout its many sub-genres that make it a cohesive musical style. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Jazz is art music that originated in the U.S. through convergences between African American and European musical forms. </li>
    <li>Jazz has unique temporal relationships (‘swing') that distinguish it from European forms. </li>
    <li>Jazz is dominated by the role of improvisation and spontaneity that creates vitality and sonority reflected in the individual jazz musician and his/her performance. </li>
    <li>Jazz is music that develops that ‘individual voice' within group interactions and opens up various musical possibilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>However you define it, Jazz has spawned numerous sub-genres, and it is these sub-genres that this article wishes to explore. By no means an exhaustive list, I have nevertheless tried to outline the primary Jazz genres of the last 100 years or so, explain what makes them musically distinct, and offer some examples of the best artists who have played and developed each genre. Where there have been artists that have played in multiple genres of Jazz (such as Miles Davis), I have indicated which of their groups or albums best exemplify that particular style. </p>

<h2>Dixieland/Chicago Style (late 1910s)</h2>

<p>The earliest forms of Jazz evolved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Evolving from a style known as "ragtime" or "playing hot", this type of jazz began to take off in New Orleans. Dixieland has some controversy surrounding its name. Although it is still used to describe the music that proliferated in New Orleans, some view it as a derogatory term associated with the pre-Civil War slave states of the Southern U.S. It has also been called Hot Jazz, or Classical Jazz. One of the first jazz recordings ever made is also one of the first recorded uses of the term Dixieland. The 1917 recordings by the "Original Dixieland Jass Band" would begin to foster a popular appreciation of Jazz. By the time recordings of New Orleans style Dixieland jazz were being made, the style had evolved to incorporate other elements that did not belong to the traditional style, such as the use of string bass instead of a tuba, and the inclusion of other string instruments that belonged to the Chicago style. The traditional elements of Dixieland's front line were trombones, clarinets, trumpets, and improvisation by the ensemble over a fairly simple rhythm of two beats. The defining sound of Dixieland is a trumpet playing a melody over top of <p>an improvising front line. The modern drum section emerges in New Orleans jazz with bass, snare, cymbal combos being common in the Brass Bands of New Orleans. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Louis Armstrong</li>
    <li>Bix Beiderbecke</li>
    <li>Jelly Roll Morton</li>
    <li>Sidney Cechet</li>
    <li>Earl Hines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Swing/Big Band (mid 1930s) </h2>

<p>This was one of the most popular periods in the history of Jazz. Swing or Big Band music is characterized by large ensembles and tended to put more emphasis on written composition instead of improvisation. Music of this era put an emphasis on showmanship with many bands having their own uniforms, theme songs, even logos. The bands themselves contained sections just like an orchestra, but these sections did no have their roots in orchestras, instead, they were inspired by the divisions contained in the front lines of New Orleans/Chicago Style Dixieland. The music itself had a smoother swing feel with a steady 4/4 time. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Duke Ellington </li>
    <li>Count Basie</li>
    <li>Coleman Hawkins</li>
    <li>Lester Young</li>
    <li>Roy Eldridge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bebop/Bop (early/mid 1940s) </h2>

<p>Unlike swing and big band music, the bebop genre is comprised of small ensembles like the trio, quartet, and quintet. The focus here is more on the improvisation of complex and angular melodies, instead of arrangements and composition. The emphasis is on virtuosity and technique and the drummer, instead of backing the band up with a rhythm, is now an interactive member of the group "dropping bombs" with soloists, as well as providing the basic rhythm of the piece. Bebop saw increased use of complex harmonies that alter or substitute standard chord progressions, as well as the use of what is known as "contrafacts" which are a new melody line that overlays a familiar harmonic structure of borrowed chord progressions. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Charlie Parker</li>
    <li>Dizzy Gillespie</li>
    <li>Bud Powell</li>
    <li>Thelonious Monk</li>
    <li>Max Roach</li>
    <li>Dexter Gordon</li>
    <li>J.J. Johnson</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cool Jazz (mid/late 1940s) </h2>

<p>With a tempo that is more slowed down relaxed, cool jazz has a lighter tone in contrast to the fast and complex style of Bebop. Cool Jazz has unhurried, calm, ‘smooth' melodic phrasings, with thinner textures and a much softer dynamic. There is an overarching emphasis on lighter tone qualities. Horns play softer, drums kick with less intensity and with an increasing emphasis on brushes. Improvisation is still just as important as it is in Bebop and other styles of Jazz, particularly collective improvisation. That being said, arrangements become more intricate, and composition played a large role. In addition, new instruments such as the flute, french horn, and oboe came to be included in the ensembles, moving the style further away from blues influence than its peers. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Miles Davis</li>
    <li>Paul Desmond and Lee Konitz</li>
    <li>Modern Jazz Quartet</li>
    <li>Gil Evans</li>
    <li>Dave Brubeck</li>
    <li>Gerry Mulligan </li>
    <li>Stan Getz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hard Bop (mid 1950s) </h2>

<p>Hard Bop is characterized by its blues, gospel and at times Latin influences. It has a driven style that is often notably ‘raw' and hard-hitting. There is a greater emphasis on funky grooves, a shuffling 8th note rhythm, and danceability. Compared to Bebop there is a greater emphasis on slower tempos, and melodies tend to be a little simpler. The main geographic areas that Hard Bop emanated from were New York City, Detroit, and Philadelphia. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers</li>
    <li>Horace Silver</li>
    <li>Sonny Rollins</li>
    <li>Clifford Brown </li>
    <li>Cannonball Adderley</li>
    <li>Charles Mingus</li>
    <li>Benny Golson & The Jazztet</li>
    <li>Miles Davis (classic quintet lineup) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Free Jazz/Avant Garde (late 1950s) </h2>

<p>Characterized by very free forms, and often containing tunes that are completely improvised by the whole collective with little or no preset change in chords. The textures are very dense, high energy, and contain a great deal of atonality and dissonance. Frequently there is a lack of piano's or string instruments, although this is not always the case. Experimental instrumentations often replace more traditional band formations. Free and Avant-Garde Jazz made extensive use of various sounds and noises that have no precedence in previous genres, and greater experimentation when it came to techniques. These genres also included the use of multiphonic sounds or instruments. Another characteristic is a greater interest and incorporation of world music in their jazz compositions, as well as 20th-century classical music. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Ornette Coleman</li>
    <li>Cecil Taylor</li>
    <li>Albert </li>
    <li>Anthony Braxton</li>
    <li>Pharoah Sanders</li>
    <li>John Zorn</li>
    <li>Henry Kaiser</li>
    <li>Bill Frisell</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fusion/Jazz-Rock (late 1960s) </h2>

<p>Fusion Jazz makes frequent use of electronic instruments instead of the traditional brass, string, and percussion instruments of the first half-century of Jazz music history. Electric pianos, synths, electric guitar, and bass became mainstays of fusion and jazz-rock, and the sax was used more often than brass instruments. Not surprising given the technical nature of these groups, studio recording, and its techniques, rather than playing in front of a live audience, was given more attention. Sonically, the focus of attention was on the rhythm section, with often repetitive bass lines, simple static harmonies consisting of simple chord repetitions, and a shift away from swing and shuffle sounds in favour of a more ‘Rock & Roll" feel. There was a great range in the complexity of pieces. Some contained simple, short passages (vamps) while others were lengthy and complex creations that were through-composed with run-on movements lacking in repetition.  </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Miles Davis (Bitches' Brew, In A Silent Way) </li>
    <li>Chick Corea (Return to Forever) </li>
    <li>Weather Report </li>

<h2>Jazz Genres in the 1980s and 1990s</h2>

<p>Popularity in Jazz took a nosedive in the 1980s, with very few younger musicians picking up the genre. As a result of this, there was really no dominant single stylistic genre or trend that came out of this period. However, that is not to say that it was not a fruitful or innovative period. Indeed, cross-pollination of styles and a general eclecticism may be the defining feature of this period of Jazz. Previous styles continued to be developed. A particular emphasis should be paid to the furthering sophistication of electronic jazz as computers, synthesizers, and recording techniques became more sophisticated. As well, bop and traditional music began to resurge resulting in neo-bop and neo-classical movements. Jazz vocal techniques and instrumentation expanded, as well as a greater more expansive role for women in Jazz genres. Globally this period is also notable for the expansion and growth of various jazz styles in world music. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Pat Metheny Group (fusion) </li>
    <li>Michael Brecker</li>
    <li>Steps Ahead (fusion) </li>
    <li>Joe Lovano</li>
    <li>Steve Coleman (M-BASE movement) </li>
    <li>Cassandra Wilson (M-BASE movement) </li>
    <li>Dave Sanborn</li>
    <li>Chick Corea's Elektric Band (fusion) </li>
    <li>John Scofield</li>
    <li>Keith Jarrett Trio</li>
</ul>

<h2>Neo-Bop Jazz (1980s) </h2>

<p>Also called neo-traditionalist or neo-classic jazz, this is a style that became popular in the 1980s. Musicians who rejected the electronic and technological evolutions popular in jazz at the time sought a return to the acoustic aesthetics of the more melodic, swing-style jazz of bebop and its relative. Most associated with Wynton Marsalis, Neo-Bop was also popular with other musicians who had ignored or rejected the Avant-Guard/Fusion movements and coveted a return to more traditional styles. Many Jazz musicians of the 1980's however thought neo-traditional jazz was, as Miles Davis famously called it "warmed-over turkey". But others welcomed the return to more traditional forms and sounds. </p>

<p>Famous Examples: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Wynton Marsalis </li>
    <li>Ray Drummond</li>
    <li>Cyrus Chestnut</li>
    <li>Eric Reed</li>
    <li>Bobby Watson</li>
    <li>Kenny Washington</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acid Jazz (1980s) </h2>

<p>Sometimes also referred to as club jazz, this genre takes various elements from a variety of other musical genres developed in the 70s and 80s, such as funk, soul, and disco. Acid Jazz begins its history in the London music scene of the 1980s before spreading across the world. It became less popular in the 1990s due to the rising popularity of electronic club musicians. Two related and intertwined movements helped develop this genre. The first strand was psychedelic styles that began being incorporated into jazz music in the late 1960s. The second strand belongs to DJs who laid beats overtop of classic jazz tracks during the 1980s to create danceable compositions. Gilles Peterson is a name most often associated with this genre, and he went on to form Acid Jazz Records in 1988. </p>

        <li>Gilles Peterson </li>
        <li>Us3</li>
        <li>Groove Collective</li>
        <li>James Taylor Quartet</li>
        <li>St. Germain</li>
        <li>Roy Ayers</li>
        <li>Brand New Heavies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>There are many more Jazz sub-genres not represented in this list, such as Dark Jazz, Electro Swing, Ethio Jazz, Free Funk, Kansas City Jazz, Modal Jazz, and many others. But most of these sub-genres are further divisions of the main genres listed here. </p>

<p>Jazz will continue to develop so long as there is music. As Duke Ellington famously once said: "It's all music."</p>
