<h2>Historical backdrop</h2>
<p>K-Pop or Korean Popular Music originated in 1885 when an American missionary Henry Appenzeller started teaching British and American folk music at a Korean school. The songs having Korean lyrics sung in western melody were named <i>changga</i>. During the Japanese rule of the Korean peninsula, such music expressed Korean feelings against Japanese oppression. Western culture started influencing Korean music and the era of a Westernised form of Korean music started. The evolution of Korean music started. The influences of radio and LP records between 1940 and 1960 gave K-Pop mass popularity till the '60s the Western pop coexisted with K-Pop and Trot in South Korea. Hippie and folk music influenced K-pop during the '60s and '70s. K-pop also produced a lot of ballads till the late '80s. It was the '90s when modern K-pop started taking its shape when it spawned an Industry propelled by recording companies or entertainment companies. The K-pop market was albeit low at the beginning of the 21st century. But, there was a turn around with the birth of the second generation of K-pop during 2005. K-pop industry was generating massive export revenues from all over the world. Japan accounted for 68 per cent of all such exports during the year 2000. The K-pop idols started gaining great popularity elsewhere in Asia too.</p>

<h2>The Industry</h2>
<p>The K-pop industry runs by synergies of the music production houses, event management companies, music distributors, merchandise and other service providers. The Big Threes of K-pop are the S M Entertainment, Y G Entertainment, and the JYP Entertainment. They also represent as 'agencies' for their produced record labels and are responsible for recruiting, training, marketing and financing aspiring artists. They also manage musical activities and public relations of such trainees. The S M Entertainment formed the United Asia Management Company jointly with Star J Entertainment, A M Entertainment and Key East in 2011. The net grossing by the K-pop industry in 2012 was USD 3.4 billion and Time magazine observed that as South Korea's greatest export. Now K-pop is a $5 billion global industry.</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>The industry is a game of two participants. First is the music company, second is the Trainee or Idol who enters into slave contracts with these companies. Founder of S M Entertainment, Lee Soo-man, devised the controversial training methodology, a concept called 'Cultural Technology'. In this, Idols or trainees are recruited through Auditions or Scouted and put through the rigours of this typical residential training methodology under contractual agreement spanning several years. They are provided with accommodation and subjected to classes teaching them singing, dancing, rapping and foreign languages like English, Japanese and Mandarin before they prepare to debut. Young trainees are allowed to attend school in parallel. There is no age bar to become a trainee and no limit to how long one can spend as a trainee.</p>

<h2>Dark side</h2>
<p>The K-pop industry has long remained under scanner for its corruption, exploitation and poor living conditions offered to trainees. The management companies have remained targets of the Western media for alleged exploitation of their idols through restrictive 'slave contracts' and forcing them to overwork, rehearse and perform often without proper sleep. A law passed by the South Korean government in the year 2014 has brought relief to the singers ensuring that there is no deprivation of basic rights of learning, rest and sleep. Some of whom are even below the age of 19. The law kept the provision of a fine in the tune of USD 10000 in the event of a violation. Another regulation passed by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission in 2017 protects the trainees from exploitation. Before such law, trainees could not solicit other companies while training at one, and companies, too, used to terminate contracts without citing any reasons. The idol agencies reservations against such regulation are well known. As per them, it leads to heavy losses as a trainee switches company. The music companies make large investments in the trainees as the contracts at least last for three years.</p>

<h2>Concerns</h2>
<p>The K-pop industry is also known for its Sexual overture and Sexual exploitation of the trainees. Critics have found that female artists compulsively wear revealing clothes and dance provocatively. Nevertheless, the matter of fact is that the sex, drug and aggression quotient of K-pop is much lesser than that in Western pop. Many singers have raised concerns about their impaired mental health due to the uncertainty of their jobs. There prevails a lack of freedom as every word uttered and every move is being monitored. Suicides committed by prominent K-pop musicians has brought forward the hidden industry pressure.</p>

<h2>Fandom</h2>
<p>K-pop musicians are often referred to as idols or idol group. A group is represented by an elder who speaks for the group and the youngest group member is called a <i>maknae</i>. The K-pop fanbase consists of mainly younger people from both major sexes. Males are often heard to confess that they have rediscovered their masculinity having part of fandom and closely following male pop groups. Japanese K-pop fans often travel to Korea in thousands to see their idols performing. Idol fan clubs often participate in charity events to support their idols. This sometimes means purchasing bags of 'fan rice' and distributing them to those in need for free. For one Big Bang's shows about 13 tons of rice were donated by 50 fan clubs around the world. Dedicated industries are functional in Korea who are instrumental in shipping such fan rice from farmers to the place of the event.</p>

<p>Another unique marketing feature of K-pop fandom is <i>Fan Chan</i>t, which generally comprises of names of group members that are 'chanted' or performed by live concert audiences during non-singing parts of songs. <i>Sasaeng</i> or obsessive idol fans are known for their penchant for invading the idols' private lives. Many Idols facing a backlash as a result of reacting angrily to sasaeng fans are known incidents. This lead to law enactment making provisions for fine up to USD 17000 and jail sentence of two years when charged with stalking.</p>

<h2>Tours and events</h2>
<p>Some famous K-pop global music events are the <i>Korean Music Festival</i> held in the Hollywood Bowl of Los Angeles, the K-POP World Festival in South Korea, KCON in California, Japan, and New York and the Philippine K-pop Convention. The international tours and such global events market the industry's produce far beyond the country's boundaries.</p>

<h2>Social media and K-pop</h2>
<p>Social media play an ever-increasing role in widening K-pop's horizons enabling it to reach global citizens. K-pop artists to remain in constant touch with their fandom around the world by using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The use of social media has increased the market revenue of the K-pop industry by 19%. Dance and fashion being part and parcel of idol group's performances, they have started benefitting hugely from video-based social media such as YouTube. Advertisements in social media by Korean music companies have successfully narrowed down the cultural gap, so much so that K-pop has become increasingly popular overseas. YouTube searches for K-pop idols has consistently increased over the years and revenues multi-folded. K-pop star Psy's Gangnam Style became the first YouTube video to secure 1 billion views in December 2012. The video talks about the lavish lifestyle of people found in Seoul's Gangnam district. He stayed up late for 30 nights to come up with the dance moves shown in the video. The song was all about poking funs at people who try hard to present themselves as that what they are not. It's the Gangnam song that catapulted the K-pop genre globally in a huge way, creating lots of curiosity among non-Korean people. Twitter has been a proven platform for getting connections and promotions by the K-pop stars. According to Twitter Korea's CEO, the use of Twitter by K-pop stars has popularised its usage in Koreans.

<h2>Industry employments</h2>
<p>The K-pop industry is a major employer too and churns out support positions in marketing, tech, social media management, analysis, creative design, film making, graphic design, illustration, and videography, to name a few.</p>

<h2>How music companies groom the idols</h2>
<p>Besides honing the musical skills of their aspirants, K-pop music companies also work for their image-building. Korean society, known for its high beauty standards, expects its celebrities to be more beautiful than commoners. To live up to this standard calls for perfection, and many aspiring and established singers alike, give in to plastic surgeries and body modifications. Company staff are known for making body-shaming comments to trainees and meting preferential treatment based upon their look. K-pop idols are known to be on a 'Paper cup diet', in which they are allowed nine paper cups full of whole grains, fruits and vegetables a day. This diet is also popular in pro-anorexia groups. Many idols get to secret binge eating at midnight standing even in a washroom. Chips and candies are big no-nos. Their exercise regimen is gruelling. Artists are asked to dance with 4 kg sandbags tied to their feet for several days. This is to make sure that their moves look much lighter when they perform without these on stage. The idols are also deprived of their love life as dating is prohibited. The theory that goes behind this is being single makes the idols more accessible to the fans. More devoted fans mean more income for the group and the record label. K=pop star Sulli who died in October 2019 wanted to break free from the stranglehold of the squeaky clean image of K-Pop. She fell victim to the cyber bullies online who trolled her for all kinds of reasons. She was found dead with anticipations of being killed.</p>

<h2>Group building and creating fans</h2>
<p>Every K-pop idol group strategically has one incredible singing talent, one "pretty" or "handsome" member (the crowd puller) and one dancing prodigy who can knock someone's socks off on the dance floor. Once members of a group are chosen, then the 'concept' of the group is decided, which changes from album to album. Each group nurtures a core image that helps to differentiate itself from the other contemporary competing groups. Every new album is called a 'comeback', be it a single, EP or a full-length one and typically one promo song is released from this album. The artists in the group will attend different music shows several times a week with this song to promote the new CD just released. There's a trend to repackage an album every two or three months after its initial release. Out of this repackage too a promotional song is released. Meticulously planned music videos and performances accompany such promotional songs. K-pop is typically known for its catchy tunes and captivating dance moves. Many of these promotional music shows are kept free entry and all that one need to do is to show up early in the venue as limited seats are allotted to fan club members first on priority. over and above the music shows fans meetings and fan signings happen immediately after a music show. Such meetings may either be low key and intimate or big events. Fans get a raffle ticket with every CD bought which is drawn to decide who gets a chance to attend such an event. This often sees top fans buying more than 10 CDs at once maximising their chance to win in the raffle.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>K-pop craze is at least 20 years old in Korea and it's fast catching up in the Western world. The industry has set a standard of its own that can be looked at with both reverence and hate. The unparalleled machinery of churning out music idols through years of uncanny practice, diet, exercise and grooming is truly awe-inspiring. The K-pop industry, one might say, has perfected the art of 'manufacturing' stars, albeit at the cost of their mental and, at times, physical health. At the same time, the dark side of the K-pop industry needs to be examined and corrected by a humanitarian approach of the Korean government so that music companies refrain from exploitative practices that are nothing short of a gross violation of basic human rights.</p>
