<p>Who doesn't love software synths?</p>
<p>But there is nothing quite as captivating as getting your hands on proper hardware equipment in the studio. Currently, the market for synthesizers is as buoyant as it has been for the past 2-3 decades, with manufacturers catering to all tastes and budgets.</p>
<p>Towards the lower end of the price scale, you will find some amazing, compact synthesizers that are capable of producing surprisingly powerful sounds. Some of them are inspired by classic synths from the past while others are completely original designs.</p>
<p>Trickle up the price bracket and you would get a lot more features in your synths, and flexibility, not to mention far better build quality. Some of the best synthesizers in the market represent a serious investment but these are objects of desire that you will treasure for many years to come. What's more, in case you decide to sell, you will likely be able to get a massive chunk of money back. For instance, look at some of the old Yamaha, Korg, Roland, and Moog classics on eBay and you will get the idea.</p>
<p>There seems to have been a slight shift away from the analog revival of manufacturers rebooting old classics while keeping an eye on hybrid engines, mixing synthesis, and sampling. Some of the modern high-end synths that have been released in the previous year or so are melding both analog and digital worlds with wavetable synthesis also chipping in on the action.</p>
<p>Moreover, let's not forget FM synthesis has made an unofficial comeback with its familiar 80s-style sounds all over the radio these days. There is still a place for virtual analog instruments in today's market, so basically you are spoilt for choice.</p>
<p>So what are the best synthesizers that you can choose from?</p>
<p>Don't worry, in this article, you will get to know some of the best synthesizers in the market currently. Buy any of these synthesizers and you will not regret the purchase even one bit. Moreover, they will function smoothly for years to come and once you want to change the synth, you could easily resell it and get a great price for it.</p>

<h2 id="arturia-microfreak">Arturia MicroFreak</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-arturia-microfreak.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Arturia MicroFreak" alt="Arturia MicroFreak"></p>
<p>With so many amazing synthesis features packed in such a small box, it would be hard not to fall in love with Arturia's latest synthesizer.</p>
<p>The multiple oscillator modes will cover a near-endless range of timbres while the filter is versatile and smooth. The Matrix will invite exploratory modulation and the sequencing tools are just the icing on the creative cake.</p>
<p>However, real magic is in the combination of them all together, making this beast far more than just the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>If you're in the market for a new synthesizer, MicroFreak should one of the top entries on your list.</p>

<h2 id="waldorf-quantum">Waldorf Quantum</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-waldorf-quantum.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Waldorf Quantum" alt="Waldorf Quantum"></p>
<p>At its heart, the Waldorf Quantum is an 8-voice, bi-timbral synth that uses high-resolution stereo oscillators that are routed through dual resonant analog (or digital) filters.</p>

<p>The sounds could be split and layered while the voices could be allocated flexibly between different layers. Each layer could have its own output for independent processing.</p>

<p>Importantly, there will be four independent synthesis engines across the oscillators (three).</p>

<p>This synth is truly stunning and capable of unique, otherworldly, or fantastic sonic results.</p>

<p>It could sound huge, thin, small, fat, warm, epic, cold, or broken, and you can easily impose your personality onto the sound using the already available parameters or use your own samples.</p>

<p>For majestic, ground-up sound design, SFX for lm/TV, weird evolving landscapes, FM-type sounds, straight-up analog synth emulation, weird evolving soundscapes, and eerie FX sounds, the Waldorf Quantum is truly unbeatable.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a bit on the pricey side, but the purchase will be a worthy investment as you will never get bored with the depth and superb sonic results.</p>

<h2 id="korg-minilogue-xd">Korg Minilogue XD</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-korg-minilogue-xd.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Korg Minilogue XD" alt="Korg Minilogue XD"></p>
<p>The new model will slot in comfortably into the Logue range between the original Minilogue model and the Prologue 8 synth. If you had to choose between this model and the original Minilogue, it would have to be the XD because of its extended general versatility, powerful sequencer, joystick for real-time control, user-customizable Multi-Engine, more inspiring vibe, user scales, and excellent motion-sequenceable stereo effects.</p>

<p>Along with the dual-CV inputs and damper pedal jack, the XD is a different flavor of Minilogue, and its unique personality is also a welcome addition to the range as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="behringer-neutron">Behringer Neutron</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-behringer-neutron.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Behringer Neutron" alt="Behringer Neutron"></p>
<p>Behringer's synth arm is best known for its controversy-courting tributes but the German brand also has a few excellent original instruments under its belt.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of Deepmind, Neutron is an analog semi-modular that packs in a ton of flexibility for its easy-to-afford price.</p>

<p>
    While the Neutron does have its scarce flaws and there are a few frustrating design issues, it still sounds amazing, and in terms of bang-for-your-buck, you simply cannot beat it.
    While it does a great job of creating sensible sounds, it also excels at coming up with weird and wonderful music.

<h2 id="korg-volca-fm">Korg Volca FM</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-korg-volca-fm.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Korg Volca FM" alt="Korg Volca FM"></p>
<p>The Korg Volca FM is an exceptionally compact, battery-powerable synthesizer housed in a plastic chassis with a design that will give a cheeky stylistic note to the Yamaha DX7.</p>

<p>The synth is equipped with a ribbon-style keyboard-come-sequencer, MIDI input, built-in speaker, and 3.5mm sync in/out.</p>

<p>This is easily the best work of the Volca range so far. While the other models have only captured the general vibe of the instrument they've taken inspiration from, the FM successfully manages to not just nail the sound of its spiritual predecessor, it also adds an assortment of new, powerful features.</p>

<p>However, it isn't without its limitations. The lack of polyphony in the synth leaves it lagging behind the original Yamaha DX7 and the FM plugins. However, the sound of dark, percussive basses, 80s-style horns, and icy mallets is bang on and if you start pushing the capabilities of this hands-on synth, you will find that it is capable of some truly amazing tricks.</p>

<h2 id="dave-smith-instruments-prophet-x">Dave Smith Instruments Prophet X</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-dave-smith-instruments-prophet-x.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Dave Smith Instruments Prophet X" alt="Dave Smith Instruments Prophet X"></p>
<p>The Dave Smith Instruments Prophet X will bring a wholly new/welcome sound to Dave Smith's already amazing lineup.</p>

<p>Because of its flexible, open sample-based architecture and tried and tested synth engine, it'll be able to cover practically any sonic ground.</p>

<p>It is very similar to the Waldorf Quantum as it has a high price but it uses the latest technology in a musical, elegant way while simultaneously pushing you into new and exciting sonic approaches/territories.</p>

<p>The build quality is pretty solid as all the knobs and switchgear feel tank-like and roadworthy. The Prophet X features a 61-note velocity, aftertouch enabled keybed of high-quality. Even though it is slightly more stiffly sprung than the Prophet 6, it'll give you more detailed control over the velocity-switched samples and acoustic instruments.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a synth that will quickly get you close to the sonic complexity of DAW plugins, then you must try the Prophet X.</p>

<h2 id="roland-boutique-d-05">Roland Boutique D-05</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-roland-boutique-d-05.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Roland Boutique D-05" alt="Roland Boutique D-05"></p>
<p>The Roland Boutique D-05 will offer something very different from the majority of the Roland Boutique range.</p>

<p>While most of its models to date use Roland's ACB technology for emulating the electronics of vintage analog instruments, the Boutique D-05 takes the D-50 as its basis, which is an all-digital Linear Arithmetic (LA) synth first released in 1987.</p>

<p>In terms of the basic architecture of this synthesizer, the Boutique D-05 is pretty much an amazing replica of the D-50.</p>

<p>As before, the patches can be split into upper and lower tones, each of which comprises up to two partials. Each partial could be either a PCM sample or be a synthesized sound created by the LAS engine.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are many fresh features as well, most notably a 64-step polyphonic sequencer and the multi-mode arpeggiator. It might not be the easiest instrument to program but you will definitely fall in love with this compact, sonically gorgeous recreation of the classic D-50.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Jg2JsMZtRRY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="studiologic-sledge">Studiologic Sledge</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-studiologic-sledge.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Studiologic Sledge" alt="Studiologic Sledge"></p>
<p>The original, Waldorf-powered Sledge was released back in 2012, and even though it was priced reasonably low and offered a great synth engine, it didn't get the recognition it deserved.</p>

<p>However, the v2.0 was a significant upgrade.</p>

<p>The front panel of the Sledge is influenced largely by the Minimoog with the classic 3-oscillator plus filter and a dual envelope layout.</p>

<p>It is definitely a great choice of design because it is familiar to most people and flows pretty nicely. Throw in the sample import options and wavetable, plus FM, aftertouch support, split/layering facilities, 24-note polyphony, and Sledge starts looking like an exceptionally great buy.</p>

<h2 id="novation-circuit-mono-station">Novation Circuit Mono Station</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-novation-circuit-mono-station.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Novation Circuit Mono Station" alt="Novation Circuit Mono Station"></p>
<p>In loose terms, Novation Circuit Mono Station is basically a hybrid of two of Novation's best instruments – a combo of Circuit's excellent sequencer and the meaty analog synth engine of the Bass Station II.</p>

<p>It is housed in a chassis that is very similar but slightly taller than Circuit, the synth's interface is divided into two halves, with the upper section featuring the synth controls while the lower portion controlling the sequencer.</p>

<p>The synth is equipped with a decent array of ins and outs, while the multi-channel sequencer, automation, and flexible mot matrix will all add up to the workflow and creative experience unlike any other synth on the market.</p>

<p>It will combine the best of digital flexibility with a classic analog design. The end result of this synth is more than the sum of its parts and with the exciting price range, it is definitely a must-try synth.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/hTV2Bq1dOzI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="arturia-minibrute-2">Arturia MiniBrute 2</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-arturia-minibrute-2.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Arturia MiniBrute 2" alt="Arturia MiniBrute 2"></p>
<p>While the original synth was a relatively straightforward monosynth with CV control and a few unique touches, the MiniBrute 2 is actually an exceptional semi-modular, that features a great synth engine with a great mini-jack patchbay.</p>

<p>The primary oscillator is capable of generating triangle, saw, and square waves simultaneously while the outputs will be blended using the oscillator mixer. It is at the mixer where they are joined by the white noise source and external audio input.</p>

<p>In terms of filters, the MiniBrute 2 keeps the Steiner-Parker-style filter used by the predecessor. It is capable of offering -12dB low and high-pass modes, plus -6dB band-pass, and notch filtering.</p>

<p>To sum it up, the MiniBrute 2 is definitely a huge success. It takes everything good about the original – the interacting oscillator shaping and Brute factor control and the analog grit, and more, and expanded on it considerably.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/wncnb8iTwnY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="behringer-deep-mind-12">Behringer Deep Mind 12</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-behringer-deep-mind-12.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Behringer Deep Mind 12" alt="Behringer Deep Mind 12"></p>
<p>
    Interestingly, Behringer's first analog synth is polyphonic to the tune of 12 simultaneous voices. With wooden side panels and a metal case, it looks and feels like the real deal.
    While the Deep Mind 12 is definitely powerful and interactive, it does lack the immediacy of some of the relatively simpler classics, like Roland's Juno-106 or Jupiter-8.
</p>

<p>That said, it is still an exceptionally great entry into the synth arena by Behringer. Unlike some of the previous products, this isn't a cut-price clone. Instead, it delivers its own take on what a $1,000 analog polyphonic synth should be and sound like.</p>

<p>Throw in a free cross-platform editing software, a three-year warranty, and 1,024 onboard presets and you will have for yourself a highly alluring package.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/_JkAqbTEq0s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="elektron-digitone">Elektron Digitone</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/425-elektron-digitone.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Elektron Digitone" alt="Elektron Digitone"></p>
<p>The Elektron Digitone makes use of the good old four-operator FM synthesis but with a few welcome twists and turns.</p>

<p>The native FM engine used is the eight-note polyphonic one and has four dedicated tracks that can be accessed directly via the sweetshop-style T1-T4 buttons, along with four MIDI tracks to control/sequence external MIDI gear.</p>

<p>Once the FM sound engine of the synth is coupled with the fantastic sequencer design, the synth will truly come alive.</p>

<p>You will be left wondering why anyone thought FM is old-fashioned and difficult to use. Of course, you will also be able to use Digitone as a simple sound module triggered from a MIDI controller, a DAW, or the onboard 16-step button for playing simple, old-school FM impersonations.</p>

<p>However, it is only after the sequencers, filters, and modulators are employed that the Digitone will show its true colors.</p>
