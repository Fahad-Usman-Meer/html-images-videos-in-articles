<p>Before we try to get details about all hip-hop dance styles, let us try to know a bit more about the Hip-Hop format.</p>

<h3>Origin of Hip Hop</h3>
<p>The actual truth is that no one has an exact idea about how hip-hop dance came into being. Many people opine that hip-hop dance is as old as the concept of dance itself. Many prehistoric paintings depict dancing figures. Anthropologists have said that dance was a major form of communication and the invention of dance is as old as the invention of written language.</p>

<p>The culture of dance passed on from one generation to the other. Since ancient times, dance has been seen as a method of expression. Dance has always been a major tool for people to express their passion, culture, and art.</p>

<p>The origin of hip-hop dance is not any different as compared to other dance forms. The dance is all about self-expression and identity.</p>

<p>The explosion and popularity of hip hop dance in the 20th century gave rise to lots of studios, and many innovative styles, and then the new hip hop broke away from the ancient tradition.</p>

<p>When the dance form began in the 1970s in America, it didn't get its origin in big studios. Instead, it started on the streets, at block parties, schoolyards, and at night clubs. Street dance was always ingrained into the hip-hop dance culture at that time. Most people credit DJ kool Herc or Clive Campbell for the new hip hop culture.</p>

<p>In most DJ parties, he found that most dancers got the maximum hype from the crowd during the instrumental breakbeat. Thus, he started using two turntables to loop the beat again and again. The longer beats gave dancers more opportunity to do their performance.</p>

<p>Thus, this was the beginning of the hip-hop dance culture. Later on, the loop beat format was given the other name called breakdancing. The hip hop dance has gone through many improvisations over the years, and it has led to many styles of dances that are popular today.</p>
