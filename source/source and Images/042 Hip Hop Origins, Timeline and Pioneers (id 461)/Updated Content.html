<p><img src="/img-temp/461-origins-of-hip-hop.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Origins of Hip Hop" alt="Origins of Hip Hop"></p>
<p>During the 50s and 60s, many white, middle-class people deserted the cities to relocate to the residential areas. The African Americans and Latino Americans remaining in the cities in the subsequent years experienced lots of difficulties. Budget plans were cut, and resources redirected to the more affluent, whiter communities.</p>
<p>Confronted with an absence of financial prospects and increased criminal activity and poverty, the young people in the Bronx and neighbouring communities started developing their own cultural expressions. These types of expression would come together to form the four pillars of hip hop. Hip hop is generally divided into 3 stages: old school, new school, and the 21st century.</p>

<h2 id="old-school-hip-hop">Old School Hip Hop</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/461-old-school-hip-hop.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Old School Hip Hop" alt="Old School Hip Hop"></p>
<p>As rapping came to be more prominent, more DJ and MC groups formed. The very first notable hip hop deejay was DJ Kool Herc. Combining percussive beats with conventional dance tunes, Kool Herc contributed to establishing the sounds that ended up being associated with hip hop, such as drum beats and record scratches.</p>
<p>Influenced by Kool Herc and his peers, hip hop deejays established new turntable methods, like needle scratching and dropping. Kool Herc also promoted rapping, which brought into play West African griots' folklore, talking blues tunes, and black power poetry.</p>
<p>As the level of competition grew, DJs started enhancing their beats utilizing sampling scratching and brief drum breaks. MCs also started enhancing their raps by utilizing more intricate rhymes and establishing flow, or the capability to rap with a sound judgment of a consistent flowing style and rhythm. Hip hop music was solely played live initially. Still, in 1979 a hip hop single by The Sugarhill Gang dubbed Rapper's Delight was launched. To everybody's amazement, it ended up being a top-ten hit globally.</p>
<p>After Rapper's Delight's advance, numerous other hip hop albums were launched, like Afrika Bambaataa's Planet Rock and Kurtis Blow's The Breaks. Most of these tunes had to do with having a good time. Still, in 1982 the Furious Five and Grandmaster Flash launched The Message, an early model of socially informed hip hop. It included a slow-moving funk score with melodic synthesizer riffs. The raps had to do with social concerns like poverty, criminal activity, and the stress and anxiety of living in an unsafe city.</p>

<p><img src="/img-temp/461-hip-hops-golden-era.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Hip Hop's Golden era" alt="Hip Hop's Golden era"></p>
<p>In the mid-80s, rap artists like LL Cool J started developing hip hop songs with appealing melodic hooks. New York City duo Run DMC also utilized hooks in their tunes but included hard-rock guitar to develop a modern rap-rock style. Their 1986 record Raising Hell ended up being hip hop's pioneer top-ten album. When hard rock group Beastie Boys started shouting out raps rather than singing, their style ended up being exceptionally trendy. Their première album "Licensed to III" ended up being hip hop's inaugural number-one album.</p>
<p>By the late 80s, lots of hip hop beats were being produced in a studio with synthesizers, drum instruments and samples from disco records and old funk. In 1987, New York duo Eric B. and Rakim launched Paid in Full, one of hip hop's most exceptional records on which Rakim raps over Eric's sample-heavy beats. In the late 80s, a new political hip hop style was established when groups like Public Enemy started requiring political transformation and ending racial discrimination and injustice.</p>
<p>In the early 90s, producers started utilizing audio editing software application and digital effects to produce new alternative hip hop styles like jazz rap, where groups like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul included R&B and jazz samples beats. The Fugees utilized reggae and soul components to produce their own new approach. All-girl group Salt-N-Pepa produced an enjoyable new style of hip hop pop. Later, in the 90s, rap artists like Mos Def, Common and Talib Kweli developed a new form of socially aware hip hop when they started rapping about social and political concerns over breakbeat grooves played by funk jazz musicians. Mos and Talib's album Black Star and Common's album Like Water for Chocolate are good examples of this style.</p>
<p>Other artists who matured throughout hip hop new school-age include Queen Latifah. She, together with Salt-n-Pepa, led women into the genre, M.C. Hammer and the Fresh Prince, aka Will Smith. Each of them popularised hip hop music much more.</p>

<h2 id="hardcore-gangsta-and-g-funk">Hardcore, Gangsta and G-Funk</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/461-hardcore-gangsta-and-g-funk.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Hardcore, Gangsta and G-Funk" alt="Hardcore, Gangsta and G-Funk"></p>
<p>The most lucrative techniques of the 90s include gangsta rap, the hardcore rap of New York and G-Funk of Los Angeles. When they rapped regarding gangster life over swinging hip hop beats with samples from martial-arts films, New York's Wu-Tang Clan produced one of the first hardcore styles. In 1994 a young rap artist called Nas launched his initial album Illmatic. Its relaxed mid-tempo beats, jazzy samples and Nas' poetical rapping made Illmatic one of hip hop's finest albums. Other popular hardcore rap artists include The Notorious B.I.G., Puff Daddy, Jay-Z and 50 Cent.</p>
<p>Los Angeles' gangsta rap advanced from the rap music of artists like Ice-T and NWA. Ice-T started by sampling funk rhythms and rapping about the perils of drugs, criminal activity, and abandoning school in tracks like the 90s You Played Yourself. The NWA members were from Compton, one of LA's most deprived and most violent areas. They rapped about oppression and police brutality in their community. Their irate raps included lots of explicit languages. The media focus this generated enabled their albums to peak the charts. Erstwhile, NWA member Ice Cube launched his timeless gangsta album Death Certificate in 1991. Tupac Shakur, or 2Pac, launched his own vintage album All Eyez on Me before being assassinated in 1996.</p>
<p>When Dr Dre, another previous NWA member, launched his album The Chronic in 1991, G-Funk was discovered for the very first time. G-Funk producers commonly sampled funk grooves by George Clinton's P-Funk groups Parliament and Funkadelic. They slowed them down to produce chilled beats with unconventional electronic effects, bass lines, and female backing vocals. G-Funk rap artists also rapped about gangsta-rap issues. Still, they concentrated on partying, sex, and drugs more than violence, criminal activity, and guns. Traditional G-Funk albums include Snoop Dog's "Doggystyle", and DJ Quik's "Quik Is The Name". Hardcore, gangsta, and G-Funk rap artists typically embraced gangster appearances and explicit language. The way they rapped about women unnerved lots of people. Numerous others, particularly young boys, embraced these styles and enabled them to emerge as traditional hip hop sounds.</p>

<h2 id="hip-hop-in-the-21st-century">Hip Hop in the 21st Century</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/461-hip-hop-in-the-21st-century.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Hip Hop in the 21st Century" alt="Hip Hop in the 21st Century"></p>

Marshall Mathers, famously referred to as Eminem, was encompassed by hip hop culture in the poor Detroit area in which he was raised. As a teen, he won regional rapping contests. He is deemed as one of the leading white rap artists. His natural flow and the sincerity and witticism of his raps swayed the crowds.

While many hip hop musicians are either rap artists or producers, Kanye is considered a maestro of both. His sample-heavy tracks have utilized symphonic music, soul, gospel and jazz, and rock and R&B, and he utilizes lots of rapping styles, from slow and chilled to aggressive and speedy. He is frequently called the most prominent hip hop musician of the 21st century because of his part in transforming hip hop's direction and the variety of styles he has helped develop, like the electronic rap of Black Skinhead and the gospel-influenced hip hop of Jesus Walks.</p>
