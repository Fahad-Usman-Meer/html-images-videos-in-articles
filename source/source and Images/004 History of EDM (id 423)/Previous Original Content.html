Because Electronic Dance Music has a variety of genres, it is important to identify the origin by looking at the start of each genre of Electronic Dance music, right?</p>
<p>The main question we need to ask ourselves is how did EDM start. Asking this question will help us to fully understand and define the origin of Electronic Dance Music. So, Electronic Dance Music was common in the 20th century. Because of this, we shall look at some of the factors that led to the start of EDM is in the 1900s.</p>

<p>There are different suggestions on the rise of Electronic dance music.

Let us look at the facts.</p>

<p>In the early twentieth century, composers and clubs began to develop a type of music that would be both entertaining and electronic. The main aim was to help people dance, and beats were combined randomly and synchronized with a playback tract to produce the music. At this time, the most common dance in need was disco-like music (even though disco had not been born yet). The EDM greatly borrows from disco music. One fact is that you cannot fully talk of the origin of Electronic Dance Music without touching on disco.</p>
<p>With the need for more disco-like music, in 1969, Delia Derbyshire developed a revolutionary album called Doctor Who. This album can be said to be the mother of modern Electronic Music Dance.
