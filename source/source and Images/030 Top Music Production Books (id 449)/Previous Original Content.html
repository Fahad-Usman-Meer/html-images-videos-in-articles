<p>Music production requires a lot of know-how to learn and perfect. Practice, of course, is the best way to improve. However, it is just as important to understand the theories and techniques garnered and honed by the masters of the craft of production. Like any art, the history of music production is full of great innovators and implementors. Luckily many of these achievements have been laid down in books that discuss the technical side of recording, mastering, mixing, or the philosophical aspects of producing great music. Reading through these books will give you a solid foundation of all the various aspects of musical engineering, giving you plenty of tools to add to your creative arsenal, and add to your awareness and creative potential.</p>

<p>What follows is a list of books every musician interested in production should read. Whether you are beginning, intermediate or advanced, you're sure to find something to help hone your skills in these titles.</p>

<p>The first three titles form an encyclopedic trilogy of sorts on recording, mixing, and mastering. I've put them at the top of this list for a reason. Simply put, they are the go-to bibles for these aspects of music production, and anyone who sits behind the production booth or in a home studio would do well to invest in them.</p>

<p>All three books are currently in their 4th edition, completely up to date with the latest tips and industry standards.</p>
