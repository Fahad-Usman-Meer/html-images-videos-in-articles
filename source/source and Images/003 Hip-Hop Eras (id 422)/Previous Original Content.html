<p>Hip hop is one of the popular music genres boasting millions of fans worldwide. Today, there are thousands of hip-hop musicians that are distributed in various parts of the continent. Despite massive followings around the continent, not many people understand the history of hip-hop music. Unlike other music genres that can be traced hundreds of years ago, the development of hip hop music started less than seven decades ago. Different from what we see today, only a handful of people knew about the genre when it first made a debut in the music scene. To a greater extent, this was expected based on the circumstances that led to the rise of the genre.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the music genre that has now become the centre of entertainment was created by African American as well as Latinos that used to live in the poorest districts of New York. It must be remembered that the districts are also linked to the rise of break dancing together with what can broadly be described as graffiti arts. Essentially, the rise of hip hop sounds was never without challenges with the majority of the challenges emanating from the stereotype that genre attracted. The first days of hip hop music saw it get associated with lots of social evils, including violence and to say nothing of drugs that were a common menace in society. Happily, most of the stereotypes disappeared as the popularity of the genre increased.</p>

<p>That aside, a good percentage of people that created hip hop are young people that faced unemployment problems. The majority of them became DJs in the local clubs, which also saw the growth of MCs. The work of an MC ranged from introducing the DJ to encouraging fans to dance to the beats to talking in time to the beat. It's important to realize that it was the talking time to beats with rhymes that invented rapping.</p>

<h2>Evolution of hip-hop music</h2>
<p>As the popularity of rapping intensified, more and more people joined hands to form what can be described as DJ and MC duos. Within no time, the sector that was once neglected started witnessing the rise in competition with every duo fighting for recognition. This forced DJs to come up with strategies that will put them ahead of the rival group. It's from this point that new techniques such as scratching and sampling short drum breaks made their way into the sector. At the same time, the MCs were forced to up their games which saw them adopt a more sophisticated rhyme that was accompanied by a smooth floor. This is how one of the powerful music genres, hip hop rose to become the international anthem.</p>

<h2>The rise of recorded hip hop</h2>

<p>The first version of hip hop music was performed live in clubs as well as in other social places until a couple of years later in 1979 when the first hip hop single was recorded. It was during this time the Rapper's Delight by the Sugarhill was released becoming the first recorded hip-hop sound. What's more, the song was received incredibly well becoming a top-ten hit across the continent something that surprised everybody, including the hip hop founders. It's the success of the Rapper's Delight that motivated other hip-hop records to be recorded. Kurtis Blow and Afrika Bambaataa followed by two powerful tracks "the Breaks and "Planet Rock" respectively.</p>

<p>Different from what we see today, the majority of the hip-hop songs that were released during this time were primarily about having fun. However, Grandmaster Flash plus the Furious Five's release, "The Message" was the first hip hop with a socially-conscious outlook, marking the beginning of a new hip hop version. Besides outlining various social issues, including poverty, unemployment as well as stress that come with living in violent cities, the newest versions carried a slow funk groove that was accompanied by what was commonly described as melodic synthesizer riffs.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Modern Hip Sounds</h2>

<p>The first version of modern hip hop music started making entry into the music sector in 1982 with the swift to the social-sensitive lyrics. Ideally, more advanced hip hop sounds with catchy melodies were witnessed in the mid-80s, and it was LL Cool J that started creating songs of this kind. This was followed closely by another popular hip-hop style, "rock-rap" that was associated with Run DMC. Unlike the previous style that LL Cool J adopted, rap-rock included hard-rock guitar besides perfect melodies. In the same fashion, Run DMC's album, "Raising Hell" which used the rap-rock style became the first hip hop album to make it to top-ten.</p>

<p>Although they were a rock group, the Beatles joins an unending list of musicians that helped in building hip hop music. For example, their debut album, "Licensed to Ill" is historic because it's the first hip hop album to hold the first spot in music ranking. By the end of the 1980s, hip hop beats were created in different ways such as drum machines, samples obtained from old funk& disco recordings and not to mention synthesizers. This is the time that saw the rise of another hip hop style that advocated for political sobriety as well as the end of social injustices that included racism.</p>

<p>More developments continued to be witnessed as we ushered in a new decade. Production labels started putting more resources in audio editing software plus digital effects that saw the creation of another hip hop style known as jazz rap. It's worth noting that jazz-rap is a mixture of both the R&B and jazz beats. More hip hop styles continued to be witnessed in the mid-90s with reggae and soul incorporated for the first time to form a new hip hop style.</p>

<h2>Hip hop styles</h2>

<p>Hip hop is one music genre that every musician followed a different style. The most important thing is that a good number of these styles were created by blending beats from other music genres. Although they were numerous styles that were used in hip hop music in the 90s, some styles performed better than others. Let's change gear and look at the top 3 hip-hop styles that were popular in the 90s.</p>



<h3>Hardcore</h3>

<p>Hardcore style is one of the successful music styles in the 90s. The music style that later came to be known as the rap of New York was created by one popular hip-hop sound, Wu-Tang Clan. The first version of the hardcore style witnessed the incorporation of the hip hop beats with samples that were extracted from kungfu films. Nas took a slightly different hardcore style in his album, "Illmatic" which was released in 1994. Unlike the Wu-Tang Clan, a young rapper applied poetic rapping with loose mid-tempo beats coupled with jazzy samples. Hip hop heavyweights, including Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, 50 Cent as well as the Notorious B.I.G also used hardcore style in their tracks.</p>

<h3>Gangsta</h3>

<p>Gangsta rap first developed in the streets of Los Angeles before spreading in other parts of the continent. The pioneers of this hip-hop style include Ice-T and NWA. While outlining various social challenges such as drugs, crime, and others in his rap, Ice-T sampled funk rhythms, which was part of the Gangsta style. Similarly, NWA members used the same style in rapping about various social injustices, including police brutalities that were common in many parts of Los Angeles. The use of explicit language helped to propel their album to the top of the chart due to the media attention that it created.</p>

<h3>G-Funk</h3>

<p>The third popular hip hop style known as G-Funk was created by Dr. Dre, a former member of NWA, in "The Chronic" album that was released in 1991. What makes G-Funk different from other hip hop styles is its relaxed beats that feature female backing vocals, electronic effects and not to mention funky baseline. Both Gangsta and G-Funk carried a similar message of social evils in society. The only difference is that the latter focused more on parties, drugs plus others than the imminent problem of violence. In general, the three hip hop styles from hardcore to G-Funk used explicit content something that put them on loggerheads with plenty of people, especially the elderly. Nonetheless, the styles continued to gain widespread popularity among the youths which the reason they're the sound of what can be described as mainstream hip hop.</p>

<h2>New Generation Hip hop Sound</h2>
<p>If you say the 2000s was a breakthrough for hip hop music, you're probably right. The 21st century has seen hip hop overtake other music genres becoming the most popular music genre worldwide. The world of hip hop has produced some of the beautiful talents that hold the high-ranking level in the music sector. For example, some of the top influential persons in the music sector such as Kanye West, Jay-Z plus many others are hip hop musicians. Consequently, various top music charts across the continent are being dominated by hip-hop songs together with albums. Not only that, the growth of hip hop music can be seen in different corners of the continent, thanks to the rising popularity that the genre has continued to gain every day.</p>

<p>At first, one could imagine that hip hop was the only music genre that was reserved for Americans. However, the 21st century has seen the music genre spread to other countries as well. Nobody can dispute that Dizzee Rascal from the United Kingdom and the Canadian Drake is the biggest hip-hop sound on the planet. One thing was clear when you look at hip hop music that was played more than six decades ago: it was only a men's show.</p>

<p>Things have since changed with the entry of powerful female voices such as Missy Elliott, Nicki Minaj, Lil' Kim, and Lauren Hill into the sector. Above all, the traces of hip-hop music can be witnessed in numerous popular songs in the 21st century. Additionally, the collaboration between hip-hop musicians and artists from other music genres has helped to popularize hip-hop music.</p>

<p>For instance, Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa's collaboration more than five years saw the release of a song that topped the musical charts in more than 95 countries. Another thing that has changed in the hip hop industry in this century is the widespread popularity of hip hop in various parts of the United States. As pointed out earlier, hip-hop music was more common in two parts of the United States: New York and the Los Angeles neighbourhoods. The good thing is that after the start of a new millennium, hip hop became the common music genre in different parts of the United States. This was the reason that made musicians from other parts that were seen as anti-hip hop join the genre.</p>

<p>Among the artists that were neither from New York nor Los Angeles that became famous in hip hop include Outkast, T.I., Ludacris and B.o.B., Three 6 Mafia, Bun B, and Lil Wayne plus many others. You'll be wrong to think that the invention of hip-hop styles ended in the 90s. The last decades have seen the rise of some of the exciting hip hop styles. The most amazing style is the underground hip hop style that's being fronted by new generation artists.</p>

<p>One of the outstanding features of the new hip hop style is the mode of play that is common on the social media channels such as Instagram and others. The chief purpose for this is to attract more followings considering that three-quarters of the world population are social media users. Today, if you're a hip-hop fanatic, you just need to have a social media account, and you'll be free to enjoy your beautiful rhythm from different quality artists, including Schoolboy Q, Danny Brown, Kevin Gates, Joey Badass, and plenty others.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Hip-hop music has gone through a series of transformations that can be traced back more than six decades. Los Angeles and New York are the two centres that gave birth to hip-hop music. The start of a new millennium has seen a breakthrough in the hip hop music genre.</p>
