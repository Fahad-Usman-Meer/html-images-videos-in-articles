<p>The most frequently asked question around songwriting formulas is,"Is there one standard formula?" In the real sense, the making of songwriting formulas has been dependent on the trend accumulating for years. It has taken years of observing the patterns of hit songs to establish common characteristics in them. Conclusions have then been made from their similarities to create songwriting formulas. This method has been effective, only that it may limit creativity is adopted permanently.</p>
<p>Despite the few top hit songs that have dared to introduce a different approach, it is risky and doesn't always work. It is like introducing a new brand in the market for a known commodity; you have to put in extra effort to convince people it is user-friendly like all the other existing product variations in the market. Let's look at songwriting formulas, why we need one, and what they comprise.</p>

<h3>Why You Need a Songwriting Formula</h3>
<p><b>Aids Decision-making</b></p>
<p>It is simpler to make a decision based on the facts you have. The world of songwriting requires urgent decision-making at times. With the presence of a formula, you will have a reference to base your decision. Therefore, you can establish a songwriting formula that works for you and use it to run along with your signature style.</p>
<p>There are moments of pressure that may bar you from making sound decisions. If you have your songwriting formula, you can use it for quick fixes in uprising hitches and cover up any mistakes. Decision-making may require custom solutions to varying natures of problems. However, you can always use the formula to give you a foundational guideline.</p>

<p><b>Boosts Confidence</b></p>
<p>There is something about knowing that boosts your confidence when dealing with any subject besides songwriting. Take an instance of music. Have you ever been in a gathering of music professionals and created an awkward moment because you weren't familiar with the terms they were using to describe?</p>
<p>Knowledge is power. A songwriting formula summarizes all the basic knowledge to have a reference when you lack access to all those notes you were given about songwriting. When you have a working formula, you will not hesitate to apply it when the need arises. You will be able to handle new songwriting gigs with more confidence and less fear of failure.</p>

<p><b>Builds Discipline</b></p>
<p>A songwriting formula governs both the art and the behavior around the writing process. It is a step-by-step guideline of what works for you when you set out to start writing a song. Once you develop your formula, you will likely have a routine around your schedule. First, identify that formula and blend it into your daily activities.</p>
<p>Repetition of activities builds discipline. For example, you may decide that you must be in a corresponding environment for every song you write. In so doing, you will develop a discipline of traveling even if you aren't used to it for the sake of your career.</p>

<p><b>Perfection</b></p>
<p>When you have a songwriting formula, it is easier to perfect your skills by having a handy guideline to direct your style. A formula shows the route you use to get to the end, which is your final song. When you have one, it is easier to adjust and get help from a professional. If I were the professional mentoring you, I would appreciate an existing formula to know what you need to adjust.</p>
<p>Therefore, strive for perfection by getting a songwriting formula to guide your way. A line in "Alice in Wonderland" says that any road will take you anywhere if you don't know where you are going. Strive for perfection.</p>

<p><b>Puts You in Charge</b></p>
<p>Often, we hear motivational speakers encouraging people to take charge of their life but very little tells you how to do it. Well, a songwriting formula helps you take charge of your career by being sound enough to know what to do and how to do it.</p>
<p>You need to get fed up with being blown around by every wind of songwriting doctrine and have one to run. When you have what works for you and keep using you, it is very unlikely that anyone will misguide you. You will also develop your signature style without trying to imitate others' styles as you work with them.</p>

<p><b>Sharpen your Ears and Objectivity</b></p>
<p>Take some time to study the techniques of other established songwriters. Study the patterns that others use and find out what is missing in yours. When you have a songwriting formula, you can easily tell what stops you from making a hit song like the ones you see trending on social media.</p>
<p>I don't mean to say that you should work exactly like a specific hit song. The more exposure you have, the easier it is to have different ideas to pick from and combine to form a new songwriting formula. Acquire a songwriting formula as a necessary template to expanding and rectifying what needs it.</p>

<p><b>The Journey to Self-discovery</b></p>
<p>A songwriting formula is one of the main components of your journey to self-discovery. How will you know what you are capable of if you don't try? With one, you can train safely. Consider starting with existing formulas implement on hit songs by those that have gone before you in the industry and see how it works.</p>
<p>If you are a beginner, you are better placed in using a songwriting formula to show you how it's done. Be intentional and use what is there to make something new. Once you have a background inmaking a song, you will know how to mix the ingredients to make a hit song!</p>


<h2>Do the Chorus Already!</h2>
<p>Please don't tire listeners with endless verses, especially when you are introducing the first chorus. Listeners are often looking forward to the lines they can sing along to or use a reference to the new dope song they have just heard. If you prolong introducing the chorus, they will get tired quickly even if your song is worth a hit.</p>
<p>Feed them slowly. When listeners love the chorus and feel connected to it, they will most likely develop a desire to know the rest of the song. Let your chorus plead your case, and don't withhold it from the audience. Make your first verse as short as you can and dive into the chorus.</p>

<h2>Hit The Tempo</h2>
<p>You have to get the tempo right if you want to keep your listeners interested. Gauging from past hit songs, most of them have heard a tempo of 120 beats per minute. However, some hit songs recorded 135 beats per minute. Listeners love something to keep their adrenaline rising, and a new dose of music will do just that!</p>
<p>The standard tempo of 120 to 135 beats per minute will evoke happy emotions in your listeners. It isn't too fast nor too slow. If you go too fast, they will be lost, and you will be left in cloud nine alone. If you go too slow, it just won't draw their adrenaline out. Give them something they can shake their heads to without breaking their necks or dozing off.</p>

<h2>Ideal Songwriting structure</h2>
<p>Verse1 –Prechorus1- Chorus1 - Verse2 –Prechorus2- Chorus2 - Bridge - Chorus3</p>
<p>You can never go wrong with that structure. In fact, it is the basic structure to follow as a beginner. I know you have done your research and heard much more spice added to some hit songs. Go easy on yourself and take one step at a time.</p>
<p>When you seem a little confused about something, go back to this songwriting structure and remind yourself of the basics. It is possible to give a hit song using this basic songwriting structure. You don't have to put out all the fancy techniques you know to get there. Take it like cooking; the best food isn't about who uses the most spices but the one who knows how to manipulate what they have to make the meal right. You need to know how to combine the skills right.</p>

<h2>Song Length</h2>
<p>There is never a good reason to prolong a song past four minutes. A hit song is introduced to the industry as something new, never experienced before. Therefore, your listeners can't spend over four minutes sampling the new product. Keep it neither long nor short, so they have just enough of it and keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>If you make the song too short, you will cut off your audience's suspense midway, and they will get fed up. Let your song take them through a brief journey from beginning to the end and give them a soft landing. With all that said, keep your song length between three and four minutes to be safe.</p>

<h2>The Right Key to Unlocking</h2>
<p>Look at former hit songs and determine what key seems to captivate the audience most. There are two keys, major and minor. Ninety percent of the hit songs are on the major key. People have a higher affinity for what makes them happy or sparks positive memories in their minds. This trait explains why so many songs in the major key trend.</p>
<p>I am not discouraging you from writing the songs you love. You may be a blues or hopeless romantic songwriter. There is still hope of becoming a hit as long as the audience relates with your song. Just know how to spark the right emotions with the right key. Some people have done cover songs for certain songs and become more popular than the original version because of the key; learn from that.</p>

<h2>The Solution is a Pre-chorus</h2>
<p>You may be feeling confused after learning that your verses shouldn't be too long. With short verses, you might never be able to enter the three to four minutes bracket. How do you go about that to satisfy both ends? A pre-chorus works well. Referring to the songwriting structure discussed above, you can add a pre-chorus before every chorus successfully.</p>
<p>Some songwriters even add post-choruses and still make good pieces. A pre-chorus adds length to your song and is shorter than the chorus. It should also be relevant to your chorus.</p>

<h2>The Ultimate Introduction</h2>
<p>The introduction you give to a song matters. Remember, first impressions last. You can easily win over or lose an audience with the introduction of a song. However, hit songs today are taking a new path. They may begin with a complete disguise of another genre and flow into the main song genre.</p>
<p>Let your introduction captivate your listeners and raise their curiosity to hear what follows. Even when your song doesn't meet all the standards, your introduction could be your biggest selling point, and listeners will listen from start to finish, just to satisfy the welcoming introduction they received.</p>

<h2>Use a Catchline</h2>
<p>You can call it a catchline or a hook because they all perform the same function; this is a word or sentence that your audience can never forget. You can easily identify a hook in a hit song by seeing the line used by most listeners to search it online. The audience may not remember the song's title or anything else about it, but they can never forget that hook that made them connect to the song.</p>
<p>Where do you place a hook? It can be in the pre-chorus, post-chorus, or the chorus itself. An audience that loves your hook will keep singing it even before they familiarize themselves with the rest of the song.</p>

<h2>Verses with Precision</h2>
<p>Avoid wordiness with your verses; let them be precise in length and content. What will happen if the audience loves both your verses and chorus? You will have a hit song! Please don't short-sell yourself by putting a lot of irrelevant information in your verses. I understand the circumstances that may have inspired your song but keep it brief and precise. You can always tell the full story in an interview when your song becomes a hit. Thank me later.</p>
