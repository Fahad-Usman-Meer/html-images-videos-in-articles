<p>808 references a sample of the bass drum of the Roland TR-808 drum synth. Although all the sounds of the drum machine are a much-loved feat of sound engineering, it is the ability of the bass to intensely shake up club walls that really gave the 808 its reputation and made it so heavily used by producers.</p>

<p>Today people refer to any deep, resonant, trunk shaking bass with a really fat low-end as an 808, but the original machine by Roland was developed and sold between 1980 and 1983 by Ikutaro Kakehashi. It was not well-liked at the time because of its unrealistic 'futuristic' sound, and it sold poorly. But its cheap price tag and loud bass drum beat enabled it to take off in the underground scene, before finally gaining popularity in a variety of music genres throughout the '80s and '90s. Today it is a much sought-after sound, and one of the most valuable pieces of musical equipment ever made.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll take a look at the history of the 808, talk a little about how it gets its unique dribbling and sizzling sounds, and how you can make tracks today with the perfect 808 emulators and clones.</p>

<h2 id="origins-of-the-808">Origins of the 808</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/445-origins-of-the-808.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Origins of the 808" alt="Origins of the 808"></p>
<p>The inventor of the Roland TR-808, Ikutaro Kakehashi, was born in Osaka, Japan, and began his professional career as a watch and clock repairman before obtaining a degree as a mechanical engineer.</p>

<p>In 1960 he was hired by Ace Electronic Industries, and in 1972 made a name for himself by founding Roland Corporation creating drum machines and synthesizers. The TR-808 was among those creations and it was one of the earliest programable drum machines available. Kakehashi originally intended for the 808 to be used to make demos and not professionally produced tracks. The designers had looked at using sampled drums instead of sound-generated by the hardware, but memory was expensive so they went for the former. Faulty transistors were purchased on purpose to give the machine its 'sizzling' sounds.</p>

<p>One of the reasons it was a commercial failure upon its release in 1980 was that it did not sound like real percussion, sounding 'futuristic' instead. People thought of it as a toy, not an instrument worthy of recording artists. Besides, electronic music was not yet popular.</p>

<p>The Roland was Rivaled by the Linn LM-1 which had a less robotic sound and sold well. But it was more than triple the price of the Roland. The 808's affordability was one of the reasons it began to catch on with underground producers, especially in the burgeoning hip-hop scene. It was also easier to use and came with several analog preloads.</p>

<p>Eventually, it would be used on more records than any of the other drum machines. Not only that, the Roland TR-808 along with other drum machines of that era, was important in the development of several burgeoning genres of music, hip-hop we mentioned, but also acid house, Detroit techno, Miami bass, and trap.</p>

<p>Before the popularization of drum machines, producers would have to find usable drum samples and create loops and patterns from scratch. But with drum machines, producers could create their own thus making it possible for anyone to produce their own music. In addition to the various genres, drum machines like the 808 helped develop, it also helped give birth to the 'bedroom producer' like Pete Rock and Rick Rubin.</p>

<p>It was none other than hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa who was the first hip-hop musician to use the 808 machine on 1982's "Planet Rock" before having more mainstream success with "Sexual Healing", Marvin Gaye's hit from that same year.</p>

<p>Almost forty years have passed since the 808 first appeared, and it is still a sought-after sound that has spawned many copycats, both as hardware and as software, to mimic its sounds. But the nuances and idiosyncrasies of the original make it hard to imitate precisely.</p>

<p>With the number of groups and producers that have used the 808 since its birth in 1980, you could write the history of hip-hop. Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, have all used it. Probably the most recent use of the 808 has been by Kanye West whose album 808s & Heartbreak made prominent use of the drum machine.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the 808 defined the early sound of the hip-hop genre, but as the '90s wore on other machines garnered favoured, except in the Southern hip-hop genre and Atlanta's "trap" sound where it retained its popularity with artists like Lil Jon, Metro Boomin and Sonny Digital.</p>

<p>Outside of hip-hop, the 808 has been extremely popular as well. As recently as Jamie XX, but going back to Whitney Houston's 1987 hit "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)". Phil Collins was also known to make use of the 808, looping rhythms over which he could add his own fills and variations on a physical drum set. Other pop artists to use the 808 include New Order, Britney Spears, Beyonce, R Kelly, Robbie Williams, Madonna, and many others.</p>

<h2 id="sounds-and-features-of-the-tr-808">Sounds and Features of the TR-808</h2>

<p>As we saw, the 808 is a drum machine that produces sound via sound-generating hardware. The TR stands for "Transistor Rhythm". Its acoustic percussion imitators are of the bass drum, snare, toms, conga, rimshot, claves, open and closed hi-hats, hand clap, cowbell, and cymbals. Analog synthesis is responsible for the generation of the sound which is designed to recreate via electronics the strike and resonance of a beater and drum head. This resulted in a fairly loud attack and quick decay. Using the step sequencer, you can program 32 patterns and chain up to 768 measures. Accents can be placed on individual beats, and the temp and time signature can be set.</p>

<h2 id="make-your-own-808-sounds">Make your own 808 sounds</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get good 808 sounds on modern equipment, instead of shelling out thousands of dollars to buy the vintage drum machine.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Get a copycat drum machine. There are many available right now from the Behringer RD-808, which copies everything on the classic machine, to the System80 808 which has many modern features the original 808 did not have. Acidlab Miami has a popular clone of the 808 which is generally regarded as one of the best. And the YOCT02 has an unmatched fidelity to the original with an exact reproduction of the analog portion (some assembly required). Even Roland itself has a clone of its own classic machine: the Roland TR-8 & TR-8S, which has unsurprisingly been praised for coming closest to the sound of the original, including all of its quirks and quarks (it's also one of the cheaper models)</li>

    <li>Another way to get those huge low-end 808 sounds is to use sample packs. 808s are staples for pretty much every beat maker out there. "Tape 808" is one of the best sample packs available with which to recreate the TR-808's analog sounds. Every sound on this sample pack was recorded using a real 808 machine, so all of the sounds are authentic. "808 Bass" is a handpicked sample pack that will give you all that huge 808 bass sounds, and "808 Trill" from 5DOLLAKITS contains a collection of trap-like sounds.</li>

    <li>If you are in a DIY mood, you can do all the hard work yourself and make 808 beats using only production techniques. You'll need a good sample to work with. Oscillate it to your desired pitch so that it can be tuned properly to your track. Make sure its frequency is between 30-60Hz, balancing it so that speaker systems can reproduce it, and so it's not too subby. The 808s should be the only thing at the bottom end of your mix, so ensure you equalize some of the other lows ends out of that frequency or else your 808s won't have the same impact. You'll want that 808 sound to have both a discernible kick and swell, so increase the attack time to round out the kick sound. Lastly, hi-pass filter all frequencies on the low end and ensure that the only instruments in the low-end are your 808s.</li>

    <li>Lastly, there are plenty of VST plugins available that will slide right into your DAW and give you those 808 sounds you desire, lets take a look at some of those in detail.</li>
