<p>There are commonly known song structures to a song. Even for those who have little to no knowledge of music theory, there are expected patterns you expect a pop song to follow. Let us look at the basic elements of a song structure before viewing their application in the song structures.</p>

<p>It wouldn't make sense to dive into song structures without understanding the elements that form them. You are very likely to experience the elements discussed below as you listen to your favorite pop music songs.</p>
<h3>Adlib</h3>
<p>It normally comes after the outro and is a deviation from the already established lyrics. It is included by the lead vocal to add some spice or intensity to the song. Adlibs are also used to fill the blanks in a song. The space between verses or chorus and a verse can create an awkward silence. Instead of prolonging the ending syllable, you can insert adlibs. They stir up emotions and make the effort put into the song stand out better. How do you insert adlibs? You can use different techniques. Some vocalists repeat the previous line with a little more oomph and vibrato, and others add in a completely different lyric that fits in the context of the song.</p>
<h3>Break</h3>
<p>A break in a song can be achieved in many ways. Let's say that a song is performed by a full band of instrumentalists and vocalists. The song may start low and progress until its climax. At this point, the vocalists may take a break and allow the instrumentalists to spice up and have fun with their instruments while remaining in tune with the song. Vocalists could be found to do things like dancing along to keep the audience entertained. Breaks are short and are proceeded by a continued climax of the chorus.</p>
<h3>Bridge</h3>
<p>A bridge is used to break the monotonous song pattern by introducing a different feel of the same song. It differs from a verse by changing the chords played. How important is a bridge? It keeps the attention of the audience by introducing a new mode of playing instruments and vocalizing. The audience appreciates unforeseen changes, and bridges keep the atmosphere lively. Bridges can also be used as transition points from one part of a song to another. However, this requires good skills to avoid losing the listeners.</p>
<h3>Chorus or refrain</h3>
<p>A chorus is a recurring part of the song, usually as long as a verse. Most song titles are generated from the chorus. Depending on the song structure, a chorus may be used to separate verses. Most songs hold the predictability of entering a chorus after a verse. On the other hand, a refrain is very similar to a chorus but is used to replace one. For song structures lacking choruses, refrains are placed at the end of the verse to mark its end. Like choruses, refrains are repetitive in nature. Refrains are not long enough to become choruses, hence their role.</p>
<h3>Conclusion or outro</h3>
<p>An outro signals the ending of a song. It wouldn't make sense to end a song abruptly after a verse or chorus. Outros are used to notify the audience of the song's gradually ending. It is like flying a plane and allowing it to go down in altitude before touching the ground slowly; it doesn't just drop down vertically from where it is in the sky. Conclusions or outros can be done using instrumental tags or instrumental and vocal tags. The first one means that vocalists stop singing, and the instrumentalists lead the song to its end with the song's repetitive chords. The second one means that instrumentalists and vocalists conclude; I often hear them repeat the chorus in low tempo or adlibs.</p>
<h3>Instrumental solo</h3>
<p>This element is recognized as the instrumentalists' spotlight moment. The vocalists stop singing, and the instruments take over and run the show. For pop songs, the instrumentalists may run with the lead vocalist's melody and embellish it with styles like riffs, scale runs, and arpeggios. In other cases, they may introduce standard progressions that seem to harmonize themselves. However, the instrumental solo should be done skillfully to ensure an easy transition and reincorporation of vocalists into the song. Therefore, instrumental solos must revolve around the song's melody or chord progression.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An introduction mostly involves instruments. However, it starts at a lower octave to allow the vocalist to join and climb up the octaves until the song's climax. The importance of introduction is that it gives the vocalists time to register the key and know where to start. The introduction may be the chord progressions of a verse or chorus played on the lower octave. In some cases, the instrumentalist breaks the cliché introduction by starting with a different key from what the song will progress with. For example, they may do the introduction at G and shift to C when the vocalists join.</p>
<h3>Middle 8 or Variation</h3>
<p>Why is it called the middle 8? Middle because it happens in the middle of the song and eight because it takes on an 8-bar form. The middle 8 slows down the song's pace and allows the audience to process the emotions of the previous lyrics before it picks up again. You can incorporate a middle 8 in your song through a new chord sequence, a melody, or a subtle twist in the song's plot. Instrumental solos are also used to create these variations effortlessly. The truth is that you are spoilt for choice on what to apply; other elements support the use of variation.</p>
<h3>Post-chorus</h3>
<p>A post-chorus could mean that the part is coming after a chorus, like another verse. However, in more complex terms, it could mean a part that proceeds a chorus, is similar to it, but is distinguishable in a way. There are many explanations as to what qualifies as a post-chorus. Some explain that it is the second section of a two-part chorus, while others argue that it only occurs from the second repetition of the chorus in a song and not the first occurrence.</p>
<h3>Pre-chorus</h3>
<p>A pre-chorus comes after a verse and separates it from the chorus.It is also referred to as the build, channel, or transitional bridge. Pre-choruses create the opportunity to shift from one key to another. For example, a song in major key of C may require a transition to G for the chorus. In this case, the pre-chorus sounds the progressive transition of the keys and connects with the chorus at the point of successful G chord achievement.</p>
<h3>Verse</h3>
<p>Finally, the verse is a correspondence to stanzas in poetry. It carries the whole message of the song. For example, a narrative pop song carries the story in the verses. Sections of a song with the same melody but different lyrics are identified as verses. They are often broken by choruses. Songs without choruses add refrains at the end of every verse.</p>

<h2 id="common-song-structures">Common Song Structures</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/421-common-song-structures.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Common Song Structures" alt="Common Song Structures"></p>
<p>Let's see what structures make up the music we listen to and sing along with. Have you ever wondered how easy it can get to predict the next melody of a song despite not knowing the lyrics? Our minds have the ability to memorized various chord progressions based on these structures. This ability is why the elements above are needed to improve quality and fun in songs.</p>
<h3>Verse-chorus form</h3>
<p>The verse-chorus form is the foundation of most of the other song structures. The others are just a variation of this one because it births them all. A simple verse-chorus form uses the same chord progression for both the verse and chorus—there different variations of the verse-chorus structure. Let us look at some songs that exhibit this verse-chorus structure before looking at the variations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Big Yellow Taxi" by Joni Mitchell</li>
    <li>"Blowin' in the Wind" by Bob Dylan</li>
    <li>"California Love" by 2Pac</li>
    <li>"Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman</li>
    <li>"Hey Ya" by Outkast</li>
    <li>"Louie Louie" by The Kingsmen</li>
    <li>"Rich Girl" by Hall & Oate</li>
    <li>"Roxanne" by The Police</li>
    <li>"What's Up" by 4 Non Blondes</li>
    <li>"La Bamba"by Ritchie Valens</li>
    <li>"Sugar" by Maroon 5</li>
</ul>
<h3>ABABCB (intro, verse — chorus — verse — chorus —bridge — chorus — outro)</h3>
<p>A is the verse, B is the chorus, and C is the bridge. A and B maintain the same progression and melody throughout the song, while C introduces a new progression and often sounds different from the rest of the song. C is like the wandering off point to break the monotony of repeated progression and requires good skill to ensurea lack of prediction.</p>
<p>However, it shouldn't completely lose relevance in the song's context. The purpose of adding the bridge is to introduce a new vibe to the song. For instance, the song could be in a major key, but the bridge comes in a minor key. The end goal is to connect two choruses using the bridge in place of a verse.</p>
<ul>
    <li>"18 and Life" by Skid Row</li>
    <li>"Melissa" by The Allman Brothers Band</li>
    <li>"Soul Man" by Sam and Dave</li>
    <li>"This Kiss" by Faith Hill</li>
    <li>"What's Love Got to Do with It" by Tina Turner</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, under this category, some songs add pre-choruses before the chorus. Some include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Enter Sandman" by Metallica</li>
    <li>"Into the Mystic" by Van Morrison</li>
    <li>"Man! I Feel Like a Woman" by Shania Twain</li>
    <li>"Mr. Brightside" by The Killers</li>
    <li>"Wonderwall" by Oasis</li>
</ul>
<h3>AABA or Verse / Verse / Bridge / Verse (No Chorus)</h3>
<p>The most outstanding characteristic of this structure is the absence of a chorus. A refrain is added at the end of every verse to mark the end of a verse and the start of another to compensate for the lack of a chorus. There are different variations of this structure. Let us see what there is to learn.</p>
<p>This 32-bar form was among the first most popular song structures in pop music and was prevalent with personalities like Bing Crosby. How does it work? The song contains two eight-bar A sections followed by an eight-bar B section that contrasts in harmony with the first two eight-bars As. The final section is another 8-bar A that returns to the original melody and harmony of the first two eight-bars. This structure became popular in the mid-twentieth century before being overshadowed by the verse-chorus form. It is the 32-bar-form because of the four eight-bar sections.</p>
<p>Some examples of songs that apply this structure are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Great Balls of Fire" by Jerry Lee Lewis</li>
    <li>"Harlem On My Mind" by Irving Berlin</li>
    <li>"Blue Moon" by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart</li>
    <li>"Heart and Soul" by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael</li>
    <li>"Blue Moon" (The Marcels) by Mel Torme</li>
    <li>"Over The Rainbow" (Judy Garland) by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg</li>
    <li>"Crazy" (Patsy Cline) by Willie Nelson</li>
    <li>"That'll Be the Day" by Buddy Holly</li>
    <li>"From Me to You" (The Beatles) Paul McCartney and John Lennon</li>
    <li>"Yesterday" (The Beatles) by Paul McCartney</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is endless, and those are just but a few pop songs that use this structure. Take time to read the lyrics and follow through with the structure to see what I mean.</p>
<h3>AAA or Verse / Verse / Verse (No Bridge)</h3>
<p>This song structure is rarely used. It may seem not very clear because of verses without choruses. Choruses often give the listeners a chance to sing along to a song even though they haven't mastered the verses. For such songs, the listeners have to master the verses to sing along. Songs under this structure may become monotonous with a repetitive melody from start to end because there is no special break like a bridge.</p>
<p>Some of the songs included in the examples below may not appeal to pop music but are great for learning. Take time to listen to them and see the lyric structure to understand why they are categorized here.</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Amazing Grace" by John Newton</li>
    <li>"Clementine" by Percy Montrose</li>
    <li>"The Thrill Is Gone" by Roy Hawkins and Rick Darnell</li>
    <li>"The Times They Are a-Changin" by Bob Dylan</li>
    <li>"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" by Gordon Lightfoot</li>
</ul>
