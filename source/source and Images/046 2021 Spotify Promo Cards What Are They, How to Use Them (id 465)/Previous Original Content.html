<h2>10 reasons why musician should be on Spotify</h2>
<h3>Subscription services will promote your catalog and increase revenue</h3>
<p>There are billions of dollars to be made in the music streaming market. In fact, Apple, Amazon, and Google have recently moved into the streaming market to provide a revenue boost to labels and create fresh opportunities in the industry.</p>

<p>The main strategy here is to make market music through playlists and increasing their catalog's Spotify streams. By attracting new followers to playlists based on genres and themes, they're able to use those playlists to 'seed' new tracks as they're released.</p>

<p>Think of this type of marketing as a form of radio promo where tastemakers are the playlist curators, where anyone could become a curator. Record labels, artists, distributors, brands, celebrities, TV shows, fans, etc. are all examples of curators on Spotify attracting new followers to their playlists.</p>

<p>While it might not seem as surprising that artists make far more money when fans purchase CDs or MP3s, but you can think of streaming as an additional source of income that'll pay you each time someone listens to your music.</p>

<p>You will be surprised how quickly this money will add up as you get more and more subscribers. Each day, the industry is getting closer to the tipping point where streaming revenue will surpass CD sales and digital downloads.</p>

<h3>Curated playlists are capable of breaking a hit</h3>
<p>Popular Dutch rapper Mr. Probz song “Waves” released the song back in 2014 and within no time it got 2.4 million downloads globally and it was streamed over a million times a day on Spotify throughout that summer. All this happened BEFORE the big streaming boom happened in recent years.</p>

<p>The song received considerable support from DJs in Europe but how did it manage to break America, traveling across the Atlantic Ocean and straight into the US Spotify Top 40 chart by early April?</p>

<p>Detailed interpretation of data from the months when the song first started breaking sows that the “lean back” mechanism of curated playlists (in comparison to the lean forward method of search that drove European streams) led to the massive success of Mr. Probz in the US.</p>

<p>Put simply, the lean back mechanism of curated playlists in Spotify carried a big hit in Europe across borders with next to no conventional support in the US for this new artist.</p>

<p>By successfully overlaying Spotify streams, radio plays, and Shazam tags onto the same chart, that it really tells you is that radio is seen to be slightly lagging behind by a full three months, and the actual number of radio spins wasn't really noticeable.</p>

<h3>Subscription services can cultivate new artists</h3>
<p>Music shifting to an all-you-can-stream model does have a hidden perk that greatly benefits everyone – data.</p>

<p>Spotify, which is available in the majority of countries has been amassing listening data for its millions of users.</p>

<p>This marriage of data and music has a major impact on the industry as a whole, a process that you can already see beginning to unfold.</p>

<p>For instance, the immense rise of Lorde was fueled in large part by Spotify, whose data team noticed Lorde trending on the service well before she became an international star.</p>

<p>Internally, the company features a team of people who are dedicated to spotting the types of trends and cultivating the artists behind them. They also work with traditional radio stations to help spot regional surges in popularity, something that was previously invisible to deejays.</p>

<h3>Subscription services will decrease piracy</h3>
<p>Various studies have revealed that piracy rates were down by over 80% in Norway, which still continues to have the highest digital revenue per capita in the world. All this is down to the rise of legal alternatives like Spotify. In fact, Australia's piracy rates came down by 20% within one year of Spotify getting launched.</p>

<h3>Subscription services will make the average consumer spend more</h3>
<p>Digital downloads haven't been able to make up for the tremendous decrease in physical sales of records over the past 15-20 years. However, Spotify's model aims to regenerate the lost value by producing more value per listener.</p>

<p>In fact, according to Russ Crupnick of NPD Group, which is a respected consultancy of the US Internet population of 190 million, less than 50% of people buy music of any form (45% to be precise).</p>

<p>The average annual music spend of the minority is just $55.45. A Spotify Premium user spends around $120 ($10 per month for 12 months) per year.</p>

<p>A Spotify Premium user will deliver more than twice the amount of yearly revenue to the industry than the average US music consumer.</p>

<p>Spotify's primary goal is to convince millions around the world to become Premium subscribers and by doing so, this will re-grow the music industry.</p>

<h3>Social and concert recommendation means free promotion</h3>
<p>Spotify users will be able to share what they're listening to via their activity feed on the desktop app, via deep integration with Facebook which all the Facebook friends can see, and via direct messaging to other users.</p>

<p>When the audience listens to music on Spotify, it is social and fans actually become promoters just by listening.</p>

<p>Spotify will automatically recommend nearby concerts to fans who listen to your genre of music or follow you, and nearby concerts will be shown to users who are visiting your discography page on Spotify.</p>

<h3>Music streaming will count towards music charts</h3>
<p>Did you know that on-demand audio streaming numbers have been factored into the US Billboard charts since 2012?</p>

<p>In 2013, Billboard added YouTube streaming, enhancing a complex formula for Billboard's Hot 100, the preeminent singles chart, which also includes on-demand audio/video streaming, physical single sales, digital download track sales, terrestrial radio airplay, and online radio streaming.</p>

<p>Never before have passionate music fans had more of an influence on the song's ranking on charts than they do today.</p>

<h3>Alerts and notifications will make it easier to stay in touch</h3>
<p>Spotify will automatically generate notifications for followers whenever you're releasing new music so that they never miss out on any releases. Notifications will include push mobile notifications, email alerts, and recommendations in the activity feed.</p>

<h3>Subscription services will pay higher rates than radio</h3>
<p>Spotify will pay 70% of the revenue that it receives back to the rights holders, which is on par with the majority of digital retailers.</p>

<p>By 'rights holders', they're referring to the owners of the music that are on various Spotify-labels, distributors, publishers, and through certain distributors and independent artists themselves.</p>

<p>The royalty rates that Spotify pays to its rights holders will be much higher than most alternative sources like your favorite video outlet, radio stations, and more.</p>

<p>Spotify will pay artists more than twice the amount that popular video partners usually pay and they're paying significantly more than terrestrial and online radio stations.</p>

<h3>Streaming is already the winner</h3>
<p>Digital sales might be up and down, weekly album sales hit new lows regularly, and the public has made its choice.</p>

<p>The public wants access over ownership. For people who are resistant to change, you can always get your favorite music in physical form or as a downloaded file. As downloads and CDs continue to decline, vinyl sales surge. However, to ignore streaming will be like choosing to live in the past.</p>

<p>More and more people are preferring to choose streaming over any other form of music consumption.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: The Final Verdict</h2>
<p>Streaming is definitely a booming method of music consumption. Spotify, in particular, is benefiting from the popularity of streaming. As an up-and-coming musician, you can do the same by using Spotify Promo Cards and using them to promote your new music and market it to more people. More number of plays will automatically mean more revenue and more popularity.</p>
