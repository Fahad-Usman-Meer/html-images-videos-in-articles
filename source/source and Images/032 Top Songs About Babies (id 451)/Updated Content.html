<p>The song's tune describes how this girl grows up to marry and have her own child. Moreover, the husband was smitten by her to the point that he actually preferred to have a little girl who resembled his lovely wife.</p>

<p>The young, unmarried couple in this 2008 country fit are facing a moment of truth as they're parked in the driveway of the lady's family home. She shares the news that she is pregnant, which she will be keeping with or without his support.</p>

<p>Hoping that he would offer words of reassurance and decide to stay, she feels crestfallen by his silence.</p>

<p>The exhausted dad in this country song from 2008 has not been able to sleep by his newborn constantly crying throughout the night but he also reassures his wife that it wouldn't be like this for long.</p>

<p>As the daughter grows into a pre-schooler and later a teenager, she brings different challenges, and at each point, offers that familiar, bittersweet refrain.</p>

<p>In this sweet, melodious 2005 country hit, the narrator is talking to her newborn baby. In awe of getting the responsibility she has now, she explains how life isn't fair all the time and she doesn't have the answers to all the problems.</p>

<p>However, she will always be there for her child to provide her support and unconditional love.</p>

<p>Technically, this jazzy 2009 pop ditty is more about waiting for a love relationship, but the lyrics and spirit in the song are appropriate for parents who are awaiting the birth of their little one.</p>

<p>This song also describes disappointments and past heartbreaks that are offset by the optimism of anticipating the future meeting of someone who will make everything worthwhile.</p>

<p>The narrator in this 2014 rock hit has found his lucky charm, the love of his life, his newborn.</p>

<p>Excited about the baby that is about to be born, he describes how he has money for a home for their family and looks forward to having three hearts beating under his roof.</p>

<p>When the young man in this hit 2003 country song learns about his impending fatherhood, all that he can think of is 'there goes my life'.</p>

<p>He is so young and feels very ill-equipped to be a parent. As his baby is born and grows into a child and ultimately a young adult, the phrase takes on an entirely new meaning. His whole world is proudly wrapped up in taking care of his unexpected daughter.</p>

<p>Stillbirths, or deaths of babies in utero after 20 weeks of pregnancy account for under 1% of pregnancies but the ones affected by the loss are left devastated for a long time.</p>

<p>In this 2012 pop hit, a grieving father emotionally addresses his stillborn child. He regretfully imagines what his firstborn child would have looked like while also describing the comfort he would have provided the baby if the baby had been born.</p>

<p>This classic pop duet released in 1974 is probably the one that first comes to your mind when you think of pregnancy ad newborn baby songs, at least that is the case for most people who love old, classic music.</p>

<p>The couple narrating this song sees the surprise pregnancy as the celebration of love. As the father-to-be is complimenting his partner on the beautiful changes that impending motherhood is doing to her body, she is letting him know that she is as enthused about the baby's arrival as he is.</p>

<p>Cradling her growing belly, the expecting mother in this 2007 pop song protects the life that is unfolding inside.</p>

<p>Even though it will be months before she gets to meet her sweet baby, the mother is still cherishing her child as an unborn angel. She eagerly anticipates the arrival of her mini version and thinks about their shared future.</p>

<p>Almost half of all the pregnancies in the US are unintended, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this 2006 country hit, the couple definitely did not plan on having a baby when they started fooling around at the start of their relationship.</p>

<p>Just out of school, the couple had just been dating for six weeks. As the girl in this song takes the pregnancy test and they wait for the results, the boyfriend also thinks about how the girl's dad will react if the test comes out positive.</p>

<p>The expecting mother in this moving 1998 R&B song is thrilled and in awe of the duty of bringing forth life into this world.</p>

<p>She also feels that she has been entrusted to give birth to an angel and take care of her.</p>

<p>Even though she is naturally torn between a potential family and a career, she decides that the baby is a reflection of God's grace.</p>

<p>Found on 'Little Creatures', this slice of 80s pop from the Talking Heads finds Bryne confused and torn between the glee of his new daughter and the implications of treating her too much like merely a plaything.</p>

<p>It is the carefree mess around even before the early morning wake-up.</p>

<p>Even though Core is known for being highly guarded about his lyrical inspiration, he did make a rare admittance that this 2005 track came after considering the impact his divorce from former wife Suzanne must have had on his kids.</p>

<p>With the several lyrical references made to the fragile, brittle objects, the track's stark honestly certainly cuts through the band's sheen in an affecting, self-deprecating triumph.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/8yn3ViE6mhY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>While it was originally written by Bill Withers and Grover Washington Jr. as a love song, Will Smith re-imagined its romantic skin into the body of his charmingly distinctively 90s jester character, to deliver a jolly ode about the loving relationship between father and son.</p>

<p>If you have felt out of touch with the changing times, you can take consolation in Smith's pains with "101 Dalmatians on CD-ROM" being too much for him.</p>

<p>Make sure you avoid watching this song if you have cute little kids running around the house.</p>

<p><img src="/img-temp/451-a-little-soul-by-pulp.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="A Little Soul by Pulp" alt="A Little Soul by Pulp"></p>

<p>Even though not strictly written for his kids, 'A Little Soul' was inspired by Cocker's experiences with his dad when he was a little child. As with most of Pulp's best songs, the track hides a dark edge behind a catchy, breezy melody.</p>

<p>Having been abandoned by his dad Mac, who left for Australia when Cocker was just 7, it is a highly heartbreaking song on how a parent could simultaneously be a father and a stranger.</p>

<p>The pain and pressure experienced by Cocker are imagined with a few sensitive, subtle touches in the track's video and released in June 1998 on 'This Is Hardcore'.</p>

<p>Julian, Sean's elder half-brother, had some of his dad's most well-known songs written for him – 'Lucky in the Sky with Diamonds' was allegedly about one of his nursery school drawings, and 'Hey Jude', initially 'Hey Jules', was a cheer-up song from McCartney in the midst of his parents' divorce.</p>

<p>However, this track was written for Lennon's only kid with Yoko Ono and is a woozy psychedelic lullaby in its dreamy quality and tender in its message. The whisper closing the track might be a tad bit creepy if it wasn't for the steel drums backing it.</p>

<p>There are tons of songs about newfound fatherhood but very few of them describe the process in quite as much detail as 'Havin' a Baby' by R Kelly.</p>

<p>R Kelly's ever so literal depiction of the arrival of his new son, Robert Jr. In the song, R Kelly will hold the listener's hand and take them on a journey, right from the moment he got the news of pregnancy all the way to his step by step narration of his newborn's escape from the womb.</p>
