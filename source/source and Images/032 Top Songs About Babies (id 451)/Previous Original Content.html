<h2>Miracle by Foo Fighters</h2>

<h2>It Takes A Man by Chris Young</h2>

<h2>Haven't Met You Yet by Michael Bublé</h2>
<p>Technically, this jazzy 2009 pop ditty is more about waiting for a love relationship, but the lyrics and spirit in the song are appropriate for parents who are awaiting the birth of their little one.</p>

<h2>Small Bump by Ed Sheeran</h2>
<p>Stillbirths, or deaths of babies in utero after 20 weeks of pregnancy account for under 1% of pregnancies but the ones affected by the loss are left devastated for a long time.</p>

<p>In this 2012 pop hit, a grieving father emotionally addresses his stillborn child. He regretfully imagines what his firstborn child would have looked like while also describing the comfort he would have provided the baby if the baby had been born.</p>

<h2>Having My Baby by Paul Anka feat Odia Coates</h2>
<p>This classic pop duet released in 1974 is probably the one that first comes to your mind when you think of pregnancy ad newborn baby songs, at least that is the case for most people who love old, classic music.</p>

<p>The couple narrating this song sees the surprise pregnancy as the celebration of love. As the father-to-be is complimenting his partner on the beautiful changes that impending motherhood is doing to her body, she is letting him know that she is as enthused about the baby's arrival as he is.</p>

<h2>Capri by Colbie Callait</h2>
<p>Cradling her growing belly, the expecting mother in this 2007 pop song protects the life that is unfolding inside.</p>

<p>Even though it will be months before she gets to meet her sweet baby, the mother is still cherishing her child as an unborn angel. She eagerly anticipates the arrival of her mini version and thinks about their shared future.</p>

<h2>Two Pink Lines by Eric Church</h2>
<p>Almost half of all the pregnancies in the US are unintended, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this 2006 country hit, the couple definitely did not plan on having a baby when they started fooling around at the start of their relationship.</p>

<p>Just out of school, the couple had just been dating for six weeks. As the girl in this song takes the pregnancy test and they wait for the results, the boyfriend also thinks about how the girl's dad will react if the test comes out positive.</p>

<h2>To Zion by Lauryn Hill</h2>
<p>The expecting mother in this moving 1998 R&B song is thrilled and in awe of the duty of bringing forth life into this world.</p>

<p>She also feels that she has been entrusted to give birth to an angel and take care of her.</p>

<p>Even though she is naturally torn between a potential family and a career, she decides that the baby is a reflection of God's grace.</p>

<h2>Stay Up Late by Talking Heads</h2>
<p>Found on 'Little Creatures', this slice of 80s pop from the Talking Heads finds Bryne confused and torn between the glee of his new daughter and the implications of treating her too much like merely a plaything.</p>

<p>It is the carefree mess around even before the early morning wake-up.</p>

<h2>Precious by Depeche Mode</h2>
<p>Even though Core is known for being highly guarded about his lyrical inspiration, he did make a rare admittance that this 2005 track came after considering the impact his divorce from former wife Suzanne must have had on his kids.</p>

<p>With the several lyrical references made to the fragile, brittle objects, the track's stark honestly certainly cuts through the band's sheen in an affecting, self-deprecating triumph.</p>

<h2>Just The Two Of Us by Will Smith</h2>
<p>While it was originally written by Bill Withers and Grover Washington Jr. as a love song, Will Smith re-imagined its romantic skin into the body of his charmingly distinctively 90s jester character, to deliver a jolly ode about the loving relationship between father and son.</p>

<p>If you have felt out of touch with the changing times, you can take consolation in Smith's pains with "101 Dalmatians on CD-ROM" being too much for him.</p>

<p>Make sure you avoid watching this song if you have cute little kids running around the house.</p>

<h2>A Little Soul by Pulp</h2>
<p>Even though not strictly written for his kids, 'A Little Soul' was inspired by Cocker's experiences with his dad when he was a little child. As with most of Pulp's best songs, the track hides a dark edge behind a catchy, breezy melody.</p>

<p>Having been abandoned by his dad Mac, who left for Australia when Cocker was just 7, it is a highly heartbreaking song on how a parent could simultaneously be a father and a stranger.</p>

<p>The pain and pressure experienced by Cocker are imagined with a few sensitive, subtle touches in the track's video and released in June 1998 on 'This Is Hardcore'.</p>

<h2>Beautiful Boy by John Lennon</h2>
<p>Julian, Sean's elder half-brother, had some of his dad's most well-known songs written for him – 'Lucky in the Sky with Diamonds' was allegedly about one of his nursery school drawings, and 'Hey Jude', initially 'Hey Jules', was a cheer-up song from McCartney in the midst of his parents' divorce.</p>

<p>However, this track was written for Lennon's only kid with Yoko Ono and is a woozy psychedelic lullaby in its dreamy quality and tender in its message. The whisper closing the track might be a tad bit creepy if it wasn't for the steel drums backing it.</p>

<h2>Havin' a baby by R Kelly</h2>
<p>There are tons of songs about newfound fatherhood but very few of them describe the process in quite as much detail as 'Havin' a Baby' by R Kelly.</p>

<p>R Kelly's ever so literal depiction of the arrival of his new son, Robert Jr. In the song, R Kelly will hold the listener's hand and take them on a journey, right from the moment he got the news of pregnancy all the way to his step by step narration of his newborn's escape from the womb.</p>
