<p>This is a compilation of musical terms in music reviews, printed scores, and program notes. In compliance with the Italian roots of several European musical norms, most of the words are Italian. The distinctive musical definitions of these phrases are sometimes different from the original or existing Italian interpretations. Many of several other terms are noted by "Fr." and "Ger." Indicating their French and German origin.</p>
<p>The words are Italian or English unless otherwise indicated. Some words are prevalent, and others are only infrequently used, and periodically new words are created. Instead of the classic terms referenced here, some composers prefer words from their own language.</p>
