<h2>6. The Verve, "Bitter Sweet Symphony" </h2>

<p>Undoubtedly, life is heartless, especially if the government takes everything, and gives very little in return. This is the interesting note the kicks off the video of "Bitter Sweet Symphony" that was directed by Walter Stern. The music video brings out Richard Ashcroft as somebody that life has reduced him to a hopeless zombie. The important thing about the music video is the fact that it acknowledges the sufferings that are subjected to people by both the government and people in leadership positions.

Walter Stern does a fantastic job in ensuring that the music video is consistent with the theme of the song. </p>

<h2>5. Paula Abdul, "Cold Hearted" </h2>

<p>Doo Wop is the oldest concept that evolved for over two decades in the 50s and 60s. The music jam was a mixture of jazz and blues rhythm. One important feature of the music track is its harmonies that come with nonsensical syllables. "Doo Wop (That Thing)" is the first single that Lauryn Hill released couple of decades ago. The video of the single was directed by two powerful producers from what was broadly known as the British team, namely: Andy Delaney and Monty Whitebloom popularly known as Big TV. To enlist from fans, the directors applied split-screen imaging, a feature that's not common in modern video production. Importantly, the music video that's cross-generational has a huge influence on the modern R&B. </p>

<h2>2. Soundgarden, "Black Hole Sun" </h2>

<p>Directed by Howard Greenhalgh, the music video of "Black Hole Sun" by Soundgarden uses mockery to outline the hypocrisy of the American complacency. In what could be seen as double stands, Howard mocks American society for rushing to television for truth whilst being at the center of the exploitations that are happening around the world. In a hilarious turn of events in the video, nature turns itself on to demand justice. This saw two young boys burnt to death by the black hole sun for humiliating a cockroach. At the end of the music video, what's seen as the arrogance of the urban population comes to an end. The clip is full of lessons that we can learn about nature and how its exploitation could destroy society. </p>

<h2>1. Michael Jackson, "Billie Jean" </h2>

<p>No secret that "Billie Jean" is one of the finest music videos that Michael Jackson produced. The music video that won Grammy Awards saw Michael Jackson challenge a restraining order from an ex-fling whilst walking down on the road. In an interview with MTV two decades ago, Michael Jackson admitted that he couldn't remember the director of the music video. Apparently, Steve Barron, the director of the music video never supported any dancing moves in the song but forgot one thing: separating dancing from Michael Jackson is a pipe dream</p>
