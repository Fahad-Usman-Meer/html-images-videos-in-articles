<p>If you believe that videos can kill an excellent music track, you're definitely right. Music video has evolved into a more powerful marketing tool that artists, as well as producers, cannot take for granted. Most importantly, the rise of several streaming platforms means that artists should strike a balance between beautiful music vocals and the resultant videos. Enough of this black hole talks, and let's focus on what brought us here – the best music videos of all time. Ideally, coming up with a list incorporating all the powerful music videos hit in the world is one hardest thing to do considering that we have endless numbers of top-notch videos out there. Let's switch our attention to what we believe are the top 21 all-time music videos. </p>

<h2 id="21-the-roof">21. The Roof</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-21-the-roof.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="21. The Roof" alt="21. The Roof"></p>
<p>We cannot deny that "The Roof" is the most incredible music video in Mariah Carey's album "Butterfly" that was released in 1997. The song that brought together Mariah Carey and Diane Martel has everything that an excellent music video should have. From boomboxes to awesome break-dancing styles, you'll love everything about this music video. The music was shot in a limousine as well as in a hotel with the images blending well with the content of the song. </p>

<h2 id="20-michael-jackson-thriller">20. Michael Jackson, "Thriller"</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-20-michael-jackson-thriller.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="20. Michael Jackson, Thriller" alt="20. Michael Jackson, Thriller"></p>
<p>Michael Jackson may have left tens of years ago, but the mark that he made in the music sector is still going strong. "Thriller" one of Michael Jackson's creations is not only the finest music videos worldwide but transformed the general aspect of video production in the music sector. It's among the earliest music tracks to incorporate plot as well as cinema style in their video. The amazing thing about this video track is its ability to include a 1950s setting that saw the video deploys a film-within-a-film style with a choreographed zombie dancing sequence. </p>

<h2 id="19-madonna-'open-your-heart'">19. Madonna, "Open Your Heart"</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-19-madonna-open-your-heart.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="19. Madonna, 'Open Your Heart'" alt="19. Madonna, 'Open Your Heart'"></p>
<p>Want to know the queen of music videos...? Well, Madonna is definitely number on the list. She is one artist with most top music videos on our list. "Open Your Heart" saw the powerful superstar take another incredible look in a music video that won the best video awards couple of times. Everything from the dancing moves to images to background colors rhyme with the message of the song. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/snsTmi9N9Gs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="18-cyndi-lauper-'girls-just-want-to-have-fun'">18. Cyndi Lauper, "Girls Just Want to Have Fun"</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-18-cyndi-lauper-girls-just-want-to-have-fun.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="18. Cyndi Lauper, 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun'" alt="18. Cyndi Lauper, 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun'"></p>
<p>Fans have different opinions on what brought Cyndi Lauper on top of the game in the music sector. Whichever reasons you have, she's still one of the best vocalists around the continent, especially when it comes to catchy pop anthems. The "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" video is an extension of the powerful pop music from a hilarious music superstar. The video summarizes everything that Cyndi Lauper believed women should be doing other than washing dishes. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/YoEczhAJGmY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="17-cyndi-lauper-time-after-time">17. Cyndi Lauper, 'Time After Time'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-17-cyndi-lauper-time-after-time.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="17. Cyndi Lauper, 'Time After Time'" alt="17. Cyndi Lauper, 'Time After Time'"></p>
<p>The discussions about all-time top hip hop sounds remain incomplete without the names of two music jams from Cyndi Lauper: "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun," and "Time After Time" popping up. "Time After Time" is the aftermath of "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun," where the superstar suffers massive rejections that lead her to what can be described as uncharted territories because of feminism chants. The music video was directed by Edd Griles. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/JjMQ6-ZQdyQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="16-madonna-material-girl">16. Madonna, 'Material Girl'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-16-madonna-material-girl.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="16. Madonna, 'Material Girl'" alt="16. Madonna, 'Material Girl'"></p>
<p> "Material Girl" may have been released more than three decades ago, but is still talking sense to the current generation. The video deconstructs feminism, materialism as well as sexuality that are common in modern society. The video saw Madonna masquerade as a gold-digger who's ready to exchange love for material gain inside a pick-up truck. The setting of the music video was similar to "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" by Marilyn Monroe. </p>

<h2 id="15-madonna-rain">15. Madonna, 'Rain'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-15-madonna-rain.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="15. Madonna, 'Rain'" alt="15. Madonna, 'Rain'"></p>
<p>Although it's not first among the equals, the video of "Rain" is special in multiple ways. First, it's Madonna's first music video to be directed by her Mark Romanek. Second, the track saw Madonna take a break from the sex-oriented musical period. Third, the song employs a simple, but refreshing outlook with shoot-within-a-shoot being the most outstanding style.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/15kWlTrpt5k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="14-madonna-oh-father">14. Madonna, 'Oh Father'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-14-madonna-oh-father.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="14. Madonna, 'Oh Father'" alt="14. Madonna, 'Oh Father'"></p>
<p> "Oh Father" is one music piece that helped Madonna to make a breakthrough in the songwriting sector. The music video that borrowed a lot from Simon & Garfunkel highlights the challenges of an abused child. The song narrates Madonna's life experiences, including her religious upbringing, the loss of her mother together with her abusive marriage. It must be remembered that the music video was directed by David Fincher with images obtained from Citizen Kane. </p>

<h2 id="13-christina-aguilera-dirrty">13. Christina Aguilera, 'Dirrty'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-13-christina-aguilera-dirrty.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="13. Christina Aguilera, 'Dirrty'" alt="13. Christina Aguilera, 'Dirrty'"></p>
<p>The "Dirrty" video attracted equal love and hate when it was released in 2002. The music video outlines the lives of teenage girls based on various aspects, including chaps, female boxing, naughty schoolgirls, cockfights plus many others. The music video did not end without Aguilera and her group of friends gets hosed down in what can be assumed as a men's restroom. </p>

<h2 id="12-bronski-beat-smalltown-boy">12. Bronski Beat, 'Smalltown Boy'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-12-bronski-beat-smalltown-boy.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="12. Bronski Beat, 'Smalltown Boy'" alt="12. Bronski Beat, 'Smalltown Boy'"></p>
<p>The music video of Smalltown Boy has been made to our top list for one reason. It's one daring music video in the sector. The video about the oppression of gays across the globe something that only a handful have the guts to talk about it openly. The video narrates the challenge of Jimmy Somerville after being presumed to be gay at one of the local pools. The young Somerville runs away from home after rejections. </p>

<h2 id="11-no-doubt-new">11. No Doubt, 'New'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-11-no-doubt-new.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="11. No Doubt, 'New'" alt="11. No Doubt, 'New'"></p>
<p>With the help of Jake Scott as the director, New succeeded in creating a new wave rock, "No Doubt" that's still the biggest hit worldwide. The success of the "No Doubt" video is attributed to the outstanding performance of each band member in a different capacity. For example, Tom was a club merchant, Adrian played as a speed freak while Tom was the club Gwen was given free roles. </p>

<h2 id="10-alanis-morissette-hand-in-my-pocket">10. Alanis Morissette, 'Hand in My Pocket'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-10-alanis-morissette-hand-in-my-pocket.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="10. Alanis Morissette, 'Hand in My Pocket'" alt="10. Alanis Morissette, 'Hand in My Pocket'"></p>
<p>The "Hand in My Pocket" video is another music video to make to our top chart and is one of the best music videos to be directed by Mark Kohr. The video portrays Alanis Morissette as a chauffeur that's too obsessed with the crowds. Although the video took a white-and-black background colour, is still one of the funniest music clips that you should watch. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/CUjIY_XxF1g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="9-daft-punk-around-the-world">9. Daft Punk, 'Around the World'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-9-daft-punk-around-the-world.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="9. Daft Punk, 'Around the World'" alt="9. Daft Punk, 'Around the World'"></p>
<p>The music video brings together a series of activities with the chief purpose of creating interesting music clips by mixing reality and fantasy. If you want to see a group of Cold War aliens as well as the skeletons of mummified women enjoying the powerful music rhythm, then Daft Punk's "Around the World" is everything you need. Not to mention the role of Michel Gondry in trying to keep everything simple while evoking dancing appeal. </p>

<p> "It's Like That" from Run-DMC is no doubt the oldest hip-hop jam in the industry. It's one of the singles that the group produced nearly four decades ago. However, the video of the new version of the song is what will make you love the creativity that's brought by the hip-hop sound. Want to know which hip-hop school is on top...? Well, watch the remix of "It's Like That" when Run-DMC meets DJ Jason Nevins in an explosive war of words. Talk of the old guard meeting the new guard in a riveting hip-hop competition and you'll absolutely be on point. </p>

<p>It may not be the best music video today, but its influence among the older generation is something that cannot be pushed under the carpet that easily. Instead of concentrating on the excessive videos that were common during their time, John Maybury took a different approach that focused on enlisting emotions. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/0-EF60neguk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Undoubtedly, life is heartless, especially if the government takes everything, and gives very little in return. This is the interesting note the kicks off the video of "Bitter Sweet Symphony" that was directed by Walter Stern. The music video brings out Richard Ashcroft as somebody that life has reduced him to a hopeless zombie. The important thing about the music video is the fact that it acknowledges the sufferings that are subjected to people by both the government and people in leadership positions. Ideally, the video strikes a balance when Richard Ashcroft, the former Verve member comes to the realization that he needs to take up the responsibility of improving his life. Walter Stern does a fantastic job in ensuring that the music video is consistent with the theme of the song. </p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/1lyu1KKwC74" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>When it comes to creating high-rated music videos, David Fincher is often leading the pack. The "Cold Hearted" music video narrates the story of a group of dancers and who arrive at the audition with Paula Abdul being the leader of the group. The panel sits in disbelief as Paul Abdul plus her team unveils their new dancing creation. The music video is a replica of "Aerotica" by Bob Fosse's All That Jazz and directed by none other than David Fincher who was unpopular then. If you're a fan of dance sequence videos, this music video will make your day. </p>

<p>If you thought the audio version of D.O.B was brilliant, you haven't watched the video version of the song yet. Courtesy of Dave Meyers, the music video is now on top of our list. The music video incorporates several dancing moves that cut across all ages. Not only that, the music video is full of energy, love, and everything that will put a smile on your face. </p>

<h2 id="3-lauryn-hill-doo-wop-that-thing">3. Lauryn Hill, 'Doo Wop (That Thing)'</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/464-3-lauryn-hill-doo-wop-that-thing.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="3. Lauryn Hill, 'Doo Wop (That Thing)'" alt="3. Lauryn Hill, 'Doo Wop (That Thing)'"></p>
<p>Doo Wop is the oldest concept that evolved for over two decades in the 50s and 60s. The music jam was a mixture of jazz and blues rhythm. One important feature of the music track is its harmonies that come with nonsensical syllables. "Doo Wop (That Thing)" is the first single that Lauryn Hill released couple of decades ago. The video of the single was directed by two powerful producers from what was broadly known as the British team, namely: Andy Delaney and Monty Whitebloom popularly known as Big TV. To enlist from fans, the directors applied split-screen imaging, a feature that's not common in modern video production. Importantly, the music video that's cross-generational has a huge influence on the modern R&B. </p>

<p><img src="/img-temp/464-2-soundgarden-black-hole-sun.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="2. Soundgarden, 'Black Hole Sun'" alt="2. Soundgarden, 'Black Hole Sun'"></p>
<p>Directed by Howard Greenhalgh, the music video of "Black Hole Sun" by Soundgarden uses mockery to outline the hypocrisy of the American complacency. In what could be seen as double stands, Howard mocks American society for rushing to television for truth whilst being at the center of the exploitations that are happening around the world. In a hilarious turn of events in the video, nature turns itself on to demand justice. This saw two young boys burnt to death by the black hole sun for humiliating a cockroach. At the end of the music video, what's seen as the arrogance of the urban population comes to an end. The clip is full of lessons that we can learn about nature and how its exploitation could destroy society. </p>

<p><img src="/img-temp/464-1-michael-jackson-billie-jean.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="1. Michael Jackson, 'Billie Jean'" alt="1. Michael Jackson, 'Billie Jean'"></p>
<p>No secret that "Billie Jean" is one of the finest music videos that Michael Jackson produced. The music video that won Grammy Awards saw Michael Jackson challenge a restraining order from an ex-fling whilst walking down on the road. In an interview with MTV two decades ago, Michael Jackson admitted that he couldn't remember the director of the music video. Apparently, Steve Barron, the director of the music video never supported any dancing moves in the song but forgot one thing: separating dancing from Michael Jackson is a pipe dream</p>
