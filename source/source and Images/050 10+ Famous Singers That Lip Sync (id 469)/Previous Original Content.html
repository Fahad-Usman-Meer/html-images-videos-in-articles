    When we use lip sync apps these days, we don't think there's any harm in doing that. But, when singers lip-sync, it becomes a big scandal. You will be surprised to know that many of our favorite singers and stars have been caught in the lip-syncing scandal.
    Lip-sync is basically a process wherein celebrities use recorded tracks of their voice, and they just lip-sync in a show to ensure that the show becomes a hit. As a layman, people think that a singer is lip-syncing simply because he/she is too lazy to sing. But, this is not the actual reality. Some people also feel that singing on a stage won't give them as beautiful a sound as in a recording studio.

<p>Most often, singers lip-sync to avoid mistakes. Singing in front of a big audience and live streaming can be nerve-wracking. But, lip-syncing offers assurance to the singer that the show won't be off-pitch. Sometimes, singers may go towards the path of lip-syncing when they are sick, and the weather conditions are poor, and if affects their voice. Thus, in rainy and winter seasons, the vocal cords of singers may get affected, and it makes it difficult for them to perform.</p>

<p>Many people feel that non-talented singers resort to these methods of singing. But, this is not the reality. Sometimes even the best singers in the world have to resort to these ways so that the live show can be great.</p>

<p>Another major reason for lip-syncing is that sometimes it becomes impossible for singers to sing while they are performing dance moves. Thus, they have to take care of breath control when they are singing as well as dancing.</p>

<p>We sometimes expect so much from our favorite singers that we forget that they are also human beings. If you don't know if your favorite star has ever lip-synced, go through this list. Following is the list of singers who can lip-sync.</p>

<h2>Milli Vinilli</h2>
<p>The first famous lip-syncing scandal happened in the 80s when it was found that the group Milli Vinilli have lip synced for a performance. The group Milli Vinilli was composed of singers Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan. They exploded the music scene all over the world in the 80s. In fact, in the year 1989, they also won the Grammy awards for the best new artist. But, after the lip-sync scandal, their Grammy award was also revoked. The scandal was so big that they were not able to record their own album. People were of the opinion that they never gave a true performance on the stage. Instead, they lip synced their whole career.</p>

<p>The music industry was appalled by common people. In an interview in the year 1990, Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan confirmed that they did this because they were poor and starving. A producer approached them to be the face of the show, but they were asked not to sing but lip-sync. Both of these singers saw a golden opportunity and thus, took the project that involved lip-syncing.</p>

<h2>Victoria Beckham</h2>
<p>Another of your favorite stars who can lip-sync is Victoria Beckham. She was famously known for her project “Spice girl.” When her Spice girl project was at the height of popularity, people said that she couldn't sing and she was just a pretty face. Many people claimed that her solo lines in the album were never sung, and one could barely hear her voice over the voice of other girls.</p>

<p>A Few years back, Victoria Beckham admitted that, yes she took the path to lip-syncing. The reason behind this was that most often, producers would turn off the mike and let other girls sing. Thus, she had to lip-sync in an entire concert. Beckham also pointed that it was not her choice but the producers' choice that she had to lip-sync in some of her shows.</p>

<p>Luckily, Victoria Beckham wasn't too excited to become a pop star. She was a part of the Spice girl group because of the fashion. She loved getting dressed up, and while working on the project, she understood that she wasn't to work in the fashion industry. Since then, she has a quite successful career in fashion.</p>

<h2>Beyonce</h2>
<p>Well, one of the most loved singers of all time, Beyonce, has also been caught in a lip-syncing scandal once. The scandal happened when she was performing at the inauguration of Barack Obama in 2013. The Internet exploded with comments that she lip-synced. Many fellow singers defended her, while some even condemned her for the lip-syncing performance. She stayed silent at the uproar.</p>

<p>But, after a few months, she admitted to lip-syncing during the inauguration performance. Beyonce has always been quite vocal about her performance. But, in an interview, she pointed out that many intricate dance routines take a toll on her, and it becomes challenging to sing perfectly in front of a live audience. When asked why she took the lip-syncing route for the inauguration ceremony, she told the interviewer that she just wanted to be perfect that day in front of the President. In addition to this, she didn't get a chance to rehearse in front of the band, and her vocals weren't up to the mark that day. Thus, she made the last-minute decision to lip-sync the performance so that she could perform best for the President.</p>

<h2>Britney Spears</h2>
<p>Britney Spears has been accused of lip-syncing many times. For many years people opined that she always lip syncs in front of the live audience. Part of the reason why most people think that she lip-syncs is that it may be quite difficult to do the dance routines and moves in the live performance. Many people have claimed how she can make such challenging dance moves when she is singing.</p>

<p>Accusation for lip-syncing got intensified when she was doing a regular show in Vegas, and she started performing multiple times a week, and she sang continuously for 90-minutes in addition to the dance moves during her performance. After she landed at her residence, her manager admitted that it becomes nearly impossible for a singer to sing for an entire show while performing dance. But, her manager also claimed that she doesn't lip-sync in an entire performance. No matter what, people love her for her voice, and she will always remain a queen in the hearts of her fans.</p>

<h2>Ashley Simpson</h2>
<p>The accusation of lip-syncing has almost disappeared in the modern era. But, it began again when Ashley Simpson was accused of lip-syncing. The lip-syncing scandal of Ashely Simpson was quite embarrassing because she attempted to sing another song whole the recorded track was different once.</p>

<p>Ashley was supposed to sing the track “Autobiography” but started to sing other songs. She tried to manage the situation with her hot dance moves, but audiences these days are too intelligent to get fooled. At the end of the show, she was bolted off the stage, and she was mortified. She took the blame for lip-syncing, but she released a few stories about why it happened.</p>

<h2>Jennifer Hudson</h2>
<p>Sometimes situations are so worse that singers have to resort to the lip-syncing path even if they are not convinced. For many high-stake events and one-after the other live shows, singers have to take the decision to lip-sync unwillingly. The lip-sync case for Jennifer Hudson happened when she had to sing the National Anthem at the 2009 Super Bowl.</p>

<p>In an interview, she agreed that she lip-synced because of the pre-game producer. The Game producer Ricky Minor confirmed that he asked Jennifer Hudson to lip-sync because it was her first performance after the tragic murder of her family in 2008. The star wanted to give the best performance. Thus, it was decided to take the lip-sync route.</p>

<p>Lip-syncing for a pre-game performance is not new. Many stars have claimed that they have lip-synced a pre-game performance. In fact, Whitney Hudson's lip-syncing performance of the National Anthem in the 1991 Super Bowl was revealed much later after her death.</p>

<h2>Venessa Williams</h2>
<p>Venessa Williams is another superstar who is claimed to give many lip-syncing performances. She is also admitted to lip-syncing in the Super-Bowl performance. She performed the National Anthem at the 1996 performance. But, after the lip-syncing scandal of Beyonce, she admitted that her performance at the Super Bowl was pre-recorded. She also claimed that she did that at the request of her producer.</p>

<p>In an interview, she also said that the main target of any producer is to garner as many audiences as possible. Thus, in front of a too-big crowd, it becomes quite difficult for a singer to perform to the best of her abilities. Thus, sometimes they have to take a short-cut route. She also claimed that too many things were going on while giving the performance at the Super Bowl. To ensure that the performance can be solid and smooth, many singers resort to the Lip-syncing mode.</p>

<h2>Mariah Carey</h2>
<p>Mariah Carey has been accused of lip syncing several times. But she never admitted it. She publicly admitted to lip-syncing after her performance at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin Eve in the year 2016. The singer was way out of the sync with the music, and the vocals were playing behind her. Thus, it was quite clear that she was lip-syncing.</p>

<p>Carey made the situation worse by joking about it and said that they should have checked the sound prior to the performance. After the revelation, she also claimed that it was the producer who needs to be blamed as he asked her to lip-sync. Carey never apologized directly for the act but she surely was mortified by the fact that people came to know about her short-cut route.</p>

<h2>Cher</h2>
<p>Another major singer and performer who has been accused of lip-syncing are Char. In the year 2013, she went into the Ellen DeGeneres show for a performance with her mother. They were promoting the album that her 87-year old mom created. The duo performed a song on the stage. But, it was clear to the audience that they were lip-syncing. The internet backlashes at her. But, she paid no heed.</p>

<p>In the end, she said that she had to lip-sync the performance because her mother was battling pneumonia. She also reminded her fans that her mom was 87-years old, and she had been working day and night to make sure that the album gets released as per the deadline. She also said that it was not a big deal; it was not as if she does it as a hobby. She had no other choice at the moment, and so she decided to lip-sync.</p>

<h2>Jeniffer Lopez</h2>
<p>After Beyonce's lip-sync scandal at the inauguration, many singers came in her support, and one of them was Jennifer Lopez. She never directly pointed that she lip-syncs. But, she said that sometimes in everyone's career, there's a point when they have to take a shortcut. She also claimed that almost all singers i</p>n their career must have lip-synced. It's just that some get caught, and some do not.

<p>Although she did not confirm directly, the way she supported lip-syncing, it seems that she can also lip-sync.</p>

<h2>Chris Daughtry</h2>
<p>American Idol Star Chris Daughtery, has also gone through a lip-syncing scandal. He was caught lip syncing in a performance in 2015 at the May Day's parade. He fired back and lashed out at the journalist. He claimed that no one sings live at the May Day parade. He said that Mariah Carey, who played after her was also lip-synced.</p>

<p>Rumors have been around for years that no one sings live in a sports event. Well, these rumors have never been confirmed, but many celebrities have opined that most often, these performances are pre-recorded because singing in front of millions of people can be quite challenging.</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons that a singer has to resort to Lip-syncing. Recording in a studio is quite different as compared to recording in front of a live audience. Sometimes, the weather conditions are not good, and sometimes the singer may be sick. No singer has the motive to disappoint their fans. But, doing a lip-sync performance is definitely better than giving a bad performance.</p>
