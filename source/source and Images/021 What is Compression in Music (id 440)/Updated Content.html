<p>Compression is one of those necessary studio processes that are way too often taken for granted and not utilized to their full potential.</p>
<p>Most producers today don't think of inserting compressors for every single channel of their DAW while mixing, but engineers of the previous generations had to learn to make the most of the few units of compression, and this helped them learn about compressors inside out.</p>
<p>Audio compression is easily one of the powerful mixing tools for a producer. It is the essential element needed for every good mix. However, to make your compressors work, you will need to understand compression first.</p>
<p>It can be quite intimidating to start learning about such a complex subject, especially when the controls and effects on the signal are difficult to understand and depend on the sound.</p>
<p>In this article, you will get to know all about compression, how can you choose the perfect compressor settings, common mistakes to avoid, and much more.</p>

<p>Compression is the process of carefully reducing a signal's dynamic range. The dynamic range is the difference between the quietest and loudest parts of an audio signal.</p>
<p>You will need to reduce the dynamic range of audio signals for them to sound natural on the recording.</p>
<p>For example – Try to think of a whisper and a scream in the same audio track. If the two of them were the same difference in loudness as they're in real life, it would be highly distracting.</p>
<p>Compressors will fix this issue by attenuating the loudest parts of the signal while also boosting the result so that the quieter parts become more apparent.</p>
<p>Experienced audio engineers will talk about how one compressor is "more musical" than the other.</p>
<p>It is an important concept, as your dynamics will be one of the most fundamental aspects to make your sound unique. If you make use of a compressor to change the dynamics, the mix engineer will become a part of your musical performance.</p>
<p>If the compressors are working properly, they will contribute greatly to the performance and make a good recording great.</p>

<h2 id="transients – understand-your-high-energy-moments">Transients–Understand your high-energy moments</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/440-transients–understand-your-high-energy-moments.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Transients–Understand your high-energy moments" alt="Transients–Understand your high-energy moments"></p>

<p>To properly understand compression, you'll need to know what transients are. Transients are the "initial" high-energy moments of certain sounds in the waveform.</p>
<p>These bursts will give your brain a lot of information about the quality of a sound.</p>
As transients are often relatively louder than the remaining part of the waveform, a compressor will affect them considerably.</p>
<p>For instance, think of a great cracking snare. As the snare hits, there will be an initial peak in the waveform that slowly tapers off. This initial peak energy is your transient.</p>
<p>Waveforms having good dynamics will have several transients because certain sounds hit and decay in the composition. Transients, and their eventual decay, will be what makes a waveform look like a fishbone.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is also a thing as a track that is too dynamic. If the song is all transients with no body, your sound is not going to be interesting to the ear.</p>
<p>The opposite will be true too - no dynamics will lead to a lifeless and fatiguing sound and a waveform that looks like a huge brick.</p>
<p>Compression will help you in finding the perfect balance for a track having a great dynamic range.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-decide-the-best-compression-settings-for-the-mix">How to decide the best compression settings for the mix?</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/440-how-to-decide-the-best-compression-settings-for-the-mix.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="How to decide the best compression settings for the mix?" alt="How to decide the best compression settings for the mix?"></p>

<p>First off, a viable rule of thumb for compression will be ‘do no harm'.</p>
<p>Remember the transients you learned about? Your compression will preserve the character of them instead of destroying them. Decent mixes will need ups and downs in energy to be pleasing to the listener's ear.</p>
<p>Even if you use a colored compressor or apply intense compression for added effect, your primary goal should be more about enhancing the natural and musical dynamics of your signal instead of destroying them.</p>
<p>When you search for the right compression settings, you should actively listen for potential changes in dynamics as opposed to shifts in timbre.</p>
<p>As you start to experiment with the settings, you should ask yourself –</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are you trying to achieve with your compression? Is it an aesthetic change or corrective?</li>
    <li>What parts of your signal are becoming more apparently loud?</li>
    <li>Is it obvious to see where the gain reduction is occurring?</li>
    <li>Do you feel you're pushing too far?</li>
    <li>What is happening to the transients and dynamic range?</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be looking for answers to these questions and more. Now, let's look at some of the parameters almost every compressor has, and what you will need to know to set them properly.</p>

<h2 id="threshold">Threshold</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/440-threshold.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Threshold" alt="Threshold"></p>

<p>Your threshold will set the signal level above where your compressor will start working. The threshold is generally measured in dB, so any signal above the threshold dB will be compressed.</p>
<p>When you're setting the threshold, you are actually deciding which part of the signal you want to reduce.</p>
<p>Setting the threshold lower means you are applying the compressor's gain reduction to a greater portion of the signal. Setting it higher would affect only the most aggressive peaks while leaving the rest untouched.</p>
<p>In order to set the perfect threshold, you should think of what you're trying to accomplish when you compress the audio and which parts of the signal can prove to be most problematic.</p>
<p>Are the loud signals of the transient distracting from the rest of your mix? Maybe your trailing decay might be inaudible in the mix?</p>
<p>You need to set the threshold so that you're hearing the compressor function on the part of the signal that you want to address and no lower. The perfect threshold setting depends on your needs. You should play the track back and try to adjust on the fly for finding the perfect amount.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/BF9Quu4QhSs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="ratio">Ratio</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/440-ratio.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Ratio" alt="Ratio"></p>

<p>The ratio will determine how much gain reduction the compressor applies if the signal goes above the threshold. It is called ‘ratio' because it is used to express in comparison to the unaffected signal.</p>
<p>Having a higher first number of the ratio will mean greater the factor by which the gain is reduced.</p>
<p>For instance, it can be said that an uncompressed signal will have a ratio of 1:1 and a brickwall limiter (which will allow no signal to go above the threshold) will have a ratio of ∞:1.</p>
<p>The most common settings are between 1.5:1 and 10:1.</p>
<p>Having a low first number in the ratio will give you a gentle compression that you could apply to an entire mix while having a higher first number will result in an intense squashing effect.</p>
<p>With the threshold affecting the range you need, you need to listen to how increasing the ratio will change the source material. Try to find the best ratio through trial and error.</p>
<p>As you keep on increasing the ratio, you need to listen carefully for when the gain reduction effect starts becoming apparent. Start right before it becomes obvious and starts to impact the sound negatively.</p>

<h2 id="attack-and-release">Attack and Release</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/440-attack-and-release.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Attack and Release" alt="Attack and Release"></p>

<p>Your Attack and Release are two very different parts of the same range of control. It is the timing with which the compressor's gain reduction begins (attack) and stops (release) acting on the signal.</p>
<p>You're already aware of when a signal goes above the threshold, the compressor will start reducing the gain based on the ratio you've set. But how the signal gets reduced will be determined by the attack and release controls.</p>
<p>Attack and Release will define whether the compressor has reached its full range of gain reduction straight away or more gradually. Together, they're the most crucial settings to achieve natural, musical-sounding compression. If you set the attack too fast and the transients will be crushed, if you set to release too fast, you will risk an unnatural pumping effect.</p>
<p>Make sure that you have a strong idea of the elements of the sound that you want to remain dynamic and set the time to achieve it. Good compression always starts with a good plan of what type of processing different sounds need.</p>
<p>You must make use of a compressor VU meter for watching how the needle moves. Is it moving in time with music? If so, you'll probably get close to the right attack/release times.</p>

<h2 id="common-compression-mistakes-that-you-need-to-avoid">Common compression mistakes that you need to avoid</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/440-common-compression-mistakes-that-you-need-to-avoid.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Common compression mistakes that you need to avoid" alt="Common compression mistakes that you need to avoid"></p>

<p>One of the glaring signs that a track is mixed by an inexperienced engineer is the improper use of compression.</p>
<p>Here are some mistakes that you need to avoid as you explore and experiment with compressor settings.</p>
<h3>Attack is set too fast on drums/percussion</h3>
<p>You could be tempted to slam the percussion elements of the mix with your favorite compressor but it is true that you can have too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>In case the attack time is set too fast, you will just be reducing the impact of the drum hits (individually) by squeezing the initial moments of the sounds too hard.</p>

<p>It is very easy to think that faster attack settings will sound better when the drums are soloed. However, in the context of the track, the drums would disappear if the transients have been limited too aggressively.</p>

<p>Remember, percussion hits are supposed to be dynamic, so let them be!</p>

<h3>Certain attack and release times can cause low frequencies to distort</h3>
<p>While this could be more of a factor with hardware compressors but different plugins, especially the ones that have faithfully model analog gear, are highly susceptible as well.</p>

<p>For instance, say that you're trying to tame the unruly attack of a bass guitar played with a pick. You are looking to set the attack time of the compressor as fast as possible to deal with the transients, but you realize that when you do this, an unpleasant distortion occurs.</p>

<p>This is happening because the period of low-frequency waves is actually very long. If the compressor's attack time is fast enough, the gain reduction might begin acting within one cycle of the sound wave.</p>

<p>This will effectively clip the waveform and produce audible distortion.</p>

<p>There are actually two ways you can get around this –</p>

<p>The first way would be to put a hi-pass filter in the sidechain of the compressor so that the detector is only ‘listening' to the high frequencies.</p>

<p>If you are using a compressor plugin, the other option would be to use the lookahead function. This function will set the compressor to respond a few milliseconds before the transient actually occurs, which will give enough time for the lengthy low-frequency waves to pass through without any distortion.</p>

<p>This can be easily done with hardware as well if you duplicate the track in the DAW, nudge it a few samples earlier on the timeline, and set it to the compressor's sidechain input whereas the original track is set to the normal input.</p>

<h3>You assume that every compressor is the same</h3>
<p>While it might not necessarily apply to you but it is worth remembering that every compressor does not work the same way.</p>

<p>For instance, the 1176 FET Compressor is one of the most important compression sounds of music and you will be excited to use it. However, for some people, it may take weeks or months before realizing that the attack and release knobs are reversed (with faster times fully clockwise and with slower times fully counterclockwise) because of the design of the analog hardware.</p>

<p>In case you start using a new plugin or a new process, you should read up on exactly how it works.</p>
