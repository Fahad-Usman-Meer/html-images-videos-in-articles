<p>Making beats has never been easier to do. There are so many online beat makers to choose from. Some are subscription-based, some are stand-alone releases, and others are included right in your Digital Audio Workspace (DAW).</p>
<p>You will need a few things before you get started like a half-decent computer and sound system, and a good-sized monitor. Although there are several options available for your tablet or smartphone, they likely won’t cut it for professional-grade beat-making.</p>
<p>You will likely also need a decent DAW. There are many excellent free options and some more expensive ones that have been around for many years that are the best in the business Like Logic Pro X, Cubase, or Ableton. Many beat makers will come in the form of plugins to your DAW, so make sure the one you are using can use plugins.</p>
<p>It also goes without saying that you’ll need some understanding of how beats work and how to make them effective, although there are several beat makers on this list that are so easy to use that your knowledge of music theory is not a must.</p>
<p>In today's music world, the humble laptop can be all you need to break into the music industry, and that’s never been more true given all the online beat makers and instrument machines available. Let’s take a look at some of the best available as of 2021.</p>

<h2 id="splice-sounds">Splice Sounds</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-splice-sounds.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Splice Sounds" alt="Splice Sounds"></p>
<p>At $7.99 for a monthly subscription, this beat maker costs as much as your Netflix subscription used to. Splice is a well-known company in the world of beat making. They are purveyors of some fine VST plugins. Their online beat make is supremely intuitive and a free trial is available before you sign up.</p>
<p>The beat maker itself is presented as a grid with a bass drum, toms, hi-hats snares, and other options along the left-hand axis. All you have to do is select your BPM, click on the place in the grid where you want your beat to appear, and click play and hear how it sounds. This gives you a great way to experiment with your sounds, and its easy-to-use interface makes it perfect for beginners just starting to explore the world of beat-making right in your browser.</p>
<p>You can also access Splice’s renowned sample to get more sounds and lay additional beats and effects over whatever you create. As well, you can listen to other producers’ creations, edit, and play around with them, making this is an excellent learning tool.</p>
<p>Store your beats on Splice’s cloud, and recover previous versions of your creation. The fact that it is compatible with most DAWs makes this a highly recommended product.</p>

<h2 id="landr-creator">LANDR Creator</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-landr-creator.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="LANDR Creator" alt="LANDR Creator"></p>
<p>Landr is a well-known online mastering service, but they also offer many other products. Among them is a decent online beatmaker called LANDR Creator.</p>
<p>Landr's Creator will allow you to create and mix beats with ease, without a DAW, and with almost no music theory know-how. Over a million (and growing) royalty-free samples are available for you to use, and their AI-based smart technology will recommend similar beats for you once you start making music with it. Creator also offers rhythm and key matching so you won't have to transpose samples to make them fit into the track.</p>
<p>Creator allows you to play around with almost any element of your chosen beat, like changing the speed or key, so that you can get your loops sounding exactly as you want.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/tfmSkHxDuYw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="soundtrap">Soundtrap</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-soundtrap.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Soundtrap" alt="Soundtrap"></p>
<p>Soundtrap is not just a beatmaker it's also a fairly basic DAW that allows you to record instruments, automate the volume levels, collaborate with others, in addition to creating beats. It has an easy-to-use interface that in addition to many other features will also allow you to record live instruments.</p>
<p>Soundtrap works almost exactly like Splice Sounds: through a process of checking boxes on a grid layout divided up on the left by customizable categories (Kick, Snare, Open and Closed Hi-hats, crash, ride, high, mid and low toms, rimshots, and others). You can customize the layers of the grid as much as you want, and choose BPM.</p>
<p>Unlike Splice Sounds, however, musical typing is allowed, enabling you to create beats live from your keyboard. Soundtrap maintains a sound library much larger than the one over at Splice Sound, providing you with plenty of royalty-free loops and samples. What’s more, you can download low-quality versions of the beats you create without a subscription. Higher quality WAV’s, however, will need a subscription.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/WsGbEq-DdVk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="gismart-beat-maker">Gismart Beat Maker</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-gismart-beat-maker.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Gismart Beat Maker" alt="Gismart Beat Maker"></p>
<p>Gismart is a free app-based beat maker that is available for both Apple and Android products making it the perfect fit for on-the-go music-making.</p>
<p>Again the common grid system interface is employed, and like both Soundtrap and Splice Sounds, it is incredibly easy to use. Gismart Beat Maker offers a few loops and preset beats that you can edit. Five effects make up the pallet that can be applied to each pad with parameter editing to round it off.</p>
<p>The free version, however, comes at the usual cost of adverts that are bound to interrupt your workflow. In-app purchases will remove this, however. But if you're going to purchase a beatmaker, or pay a subscription for one, likely, you will not find the Gismart Beat Maker professional enough for your needs.</p>
<p>For that, you’ll want to take a look at the next entry on this list.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/MdUfMii-KTg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="intua">Intua</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-intua.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Intua" alt="Intua"></p>
<p>This beatmaker is much more advanced than the ones that have preceded this entry. Sporting an incredibly detailed and expansive studio space, Intua is a great on-the-go beat maker for your tablet and smartphone.</p>
<p>From this app, you will have everything you need to make professional-quality tracks with the added benefit of portability. Full of features like MIDI capability, AUv3, and IAA support. Intuit offers precise sequencing and a full-featured mixer enabling you to perfect your mixes with ease.</p>
<p>Editing both instrumental sounds and beats is easy to do with its high-quality UI. A ‘flexible scene mode’ will make remixing or live performances possible with its professional display. And finally, Intua contains a sound library that is constantly growing and filled with samples from all genres and styles that sound professional and ready to use.</p>
<p>The price point is a little higher than the others on this list at $24.99, but remember you are buying a full program, not a monthly subscription. And you might want to be aware that there is a bit of a learning curve with the app, so having some experience with how beat makers work is a benefit. Or at least prepare to spend some time tinkering with it before you can expect to be taking advantage of its fullest abilities.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/TAMQ6hzY1uk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="serato-studio">Serato Studio</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-serato-studio.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Serato Studio" alt="Serato Studio"></p>
<p>Serato products are familiar to DJ’s the world over, and this beat-making software lives up to the quality expected of this brand. This handy tool will not only allow you to get your ideas onto the program quickly with its efficient workflow, but it is also easy enough to use that beginners won't have any trouble initiating themselves into the world of production.</p>
<p>Containing a fast and pared-down workflow, Serato Studio offers several professional-sounding drum patterns, synchable BPM, and key shifting that’s just a click away.</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with using Serato’s other products, such as Serato DJ, this software, which has the same look and feel,</p>will feel familiar to you as soon as you open it. It will also work with most DJ equipment.
<p>The subscription costs $9.99, but there is a free trial you can take advantage of. Regular software updates are included, as well as sound packs and many great VST plugins. Stem exporting and automation are also available.</p>
<p>There is, however, a downside that is worth mentioning: you will not be able to ‘audition’ loops before you add them to your track. However, despite that minor drawback, this is an excellent piece of software. Not nearly as simple as Gismart or Soundtrap, but making it a perfect mid-ranged product that will have you producing amazing beats with minimal effort.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/sE-51e5l05E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="magix-musix-maker">MAGIX Musix Maker</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-magix-musix-maker.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="MAGIX Musix Maker" alt="MAGIX Musix Maker"></p>
<p>This is another superb, easy-to-use DAW that will allow for some great beat-making via drag and drop functions. What sets MAGIX Music Maker apart from the other entry-level products on this list is that it makes use of a huge library of sound collections. Just drag and drop the loops you want into the beatmaker and go. You hardly need to understand what you are doing musically to get this thing producing some interesting sounds. Admittedly this will be a drawback to those in the market for a more professional product. But you have to start somewhere, and this is a fine choice.</p>
<p>Every loop offered comes in a range of different pitches. Editing is easy with a whole slew of drag and drop effects. MIDI compatibility is available and so is instrument recording. But there is very limited choice in terms of mixing options. Also limited is the usable instruments per track which is hardly ideal for its $99.99 price tag (with a limited free option available).</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/rcwib_QxISU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="ordrumbox">OrDrumBox</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-ordrumbox.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="OrDrumBox" alt="OrDrumBox"></p>
<p>This free beat maker’s claim to fame is its auto-composition. Baselines, melodic patterns, even complete songs can be cranked out by its software algorithms, allowing for free and easy-to-use experimentation possibilities.</p>
<p>The grid system is in use again, and a fair range of sounds are offered for free, with more available for purchase from the OrDrumBox website. Automatic track matching will allow you to sync several tracks together based on their rhythm and bpm. Additionally, WAV files of extra sound effects can be imported. You will, however, require some knowledge of step sequencing to operate this free online beat maker, and its UI is quite outdated.</p>
<p>While this will not be the most professional online beat maker in your toolkit, its ability to allow for quick experiments certainly makes it a worthy addition to this list.</p>

<h2 id="garageband">Garageband</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-garageband.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Garageband" alt="Garageband"></p>
<p>Garageband is pre-installed on every Mac OS and has been for many years. If you're using a mac, you likely already have it in your application folder. Garageband is an effective little program that many amateur musicians turn to play around with, it's as user-friendly as you would expect from Apple and comes with some pretty powerful beat-making features.</p>
<p>Garageband has come a long way since it was first introduced by Apple in the early aughts. It now contains an impressive swath of instruments, and some pretty powerful mixing and mastering abilities. You can easily record multiple tracks and editing is fairly simple and user-friendly. It does not contain a mixing board, however, and mastering is hardly comparable to what you would get from a pro-level DAW.</p>
<p>Smart instruments are provided for beginners who want to quickly make music. Loops and Samples are available alongside real instrument recording abilities, and its beat sequencer is intuitive and easy to use. Like most of the platforms on this list, the beat sequencer uses a grid interface that operates just like the others.</p>
<p>The downside is that Garageband is not a stand-alone beatmaker. You will get many more features out of some of the other beatmakers on this list.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/CFlcLTqzIR8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="lmms">LMMS</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/424-lmms.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="LMMS" alt="LMMS"></p>
<p>This last product was tailor-designed for musicians by musicians and therefore contains all of the functionality you could possibly want from a beatmaker.</p>
<p>This detailed piece of beat software is enabled for both MIDI and musical typing and contains an editorial piano roll. Sequencing, comprising, mixing, and automating your tracks can all be done in one place thanks to its easy-to-use UI. VST plugins are supported, and there are several mixing effects built right into the program.</p>
<p>What about the downsides? Well, this is freeware so there are limitations. There are not that many sounds and instruments to use, reviewers have pointed out that the software is quite buggy at times. That being said, this is a great option for the producer on a budget.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/3qfa9hGJzoY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you have it, 10 unique beat makers available online for you to toy around with. If you are not already familiar with beat-making software, why not try out one of the free ones that has limited functionality before diving into some of the more professional options. That way you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into, and will be able to make the most of professional-level software. Before you know it, you’ll be hooking up your drum pads, or laying down loops with your keyboard, instead of relying on pre-recorded sounds.</p>
