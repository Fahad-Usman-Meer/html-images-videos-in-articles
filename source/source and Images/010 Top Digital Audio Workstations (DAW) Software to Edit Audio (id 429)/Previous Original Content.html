<p>Since successfully acquiring digital audio legend Cycling'74 in 2017, the company has been able to offer an insanely flexible Max digital signal processing environment Live as Max4Live. This makes Live one of the most versatile sound design tools out there.</p>

<h2>Studio One 4.5</h2>
<p>Studio One was Presonus' entry to the DAW scene.</p>
