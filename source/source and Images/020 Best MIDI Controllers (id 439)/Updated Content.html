<p>In this article, we will take a look at the best MIDI controllers available across various devices, and for various levels of experience. Whatever your studio set-up might look like, there is something here for you.</p>

<h3>What is a MIDI Controller?</h3>

<p>MIDI Controllers are piano-like pieces of equipment that can be connected to your computer or mobile device, usually via USB, but also via Bluetooth. They will let you record what you play directly into your Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and any Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugins you may have.</p>

<p>There is a large variety of sizes and types of MIDI controllers depending on what your needs are. Ranging from portable, compact units, to the full-fledges 88 note models. Knobs, pads, faders are usually included, giving you more control over your sound.</p>

<p>Cheaper models will cost you less than $100 in some cases. Higher quality MIDI controllers will be significantly more expensive, but you will get many more features and better quality sound. In addition, the better quality keyboards will come working with the popular DAWs right out of the box.</p>

<p>There are two basic categories of keyboard: smaller portable models containing 25 keys (such as the Novation LaunchKey Mini Mk3), and larger models that require a stand or desk, containing 49 or more keys (such as the Native Instruments Kontol S61 Mk2). Which category is best for you is entirely dependant on your needs as a musician. But something to note is that even the smaller models come with octave shifting, which means that regardless of the size you will have the access to the complete range of notes. If you are an advanced keyboard player, or you learning to play with two hands is a goal, four or five-octave keyboards would be best.</p>

<h2 id="nektar-se25-midi-keyboard">Nektar SE25 MIDI Keyboard</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-nektar-se25-midi-keyboard.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Nektar SE25 MIDI Keyboard" alt="Nektar SE25 MIDI Keyboard"></p>

<p>This lightweight keyboard is perfect for the on-the-go musician. You'll have no trouble fitting it into your laptop bag, and it's no slouch when it comes to features giving you a great deal of value for its $49 price tag.</p>

<p>Unlike many budget MIDI controllers, Nektar's SE25 provides DAW integration for a variety of popular DAWS including Cubase, Garageband, Logic, Reaper, Studio One, and many others. It is compatible with both Mac OS and Windows and contains 25 velocity-sensitive mini-keys. Buttons included pitch bending, volume, octave change, pan and track, transpose, as well as sustain and modulation.</p>

<p>Weighing less than half a kilo, this practical, portable player will give you nearly everything you need for a price that's hard to argue with.</p>

<h2 id="akai-mpk-mini-mkii-midi-keyboard">Akai MPK Mini MkII MIDI Keyboard</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-akai-mpk-mini-mkii-midi-keyboard.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Akai MPK Mini MkII MIDI Keyboard" alt="Akai MPK Mini MkII MIDI Keyboard"></p>

<p>Although this keyboard is over five years old, making it one of the older products on this list, it still ranks near the top for portable MIDI players because it offers a perfect balance between features and affordability.</p>

<p>Currently, you can buy this lightweight MIDI controller for about $120. It comes with a 4-way pitch bend joystick that also controls modulation. An arp and repeat functions, as well as several knobs, round out the features. 8 MPC pads are generously sized and come with note repeat functions.</p>

<p>Several software options come along for the ride as well, including AIR Music Tech's Hybrid 3, Akai Pro MPC Essentials, and SONIVOX Wobble. The MPK Mini is a tried-and-trusted lightweight MIDI controller that will allow you to control studio software at home or on the go.</p>

<h2 id="novation-launchkey-mini-mk3">Novation Launchkey Mini Mk3</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-novation-launchkey-mini-mk3.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Novation Launchkey Mini Mk3" alt="Novation Launchkey Mini Mk3"></p>

<p>If your an Ableton Live user, this is the Mini MIDI controller for you. Recently updated, this excellent piece of hardware is chock-full of features, many of which were missing from the previous versions of Novation's Mini. Pitch bending, arpeggiator, chord memory, and modulation strips are all now included, as well as MIDI out and a TRS jack (although no MIDI adapter is included).</p>

<p>Other features include 16 drum pads with velocity-sensitivity that will allow you lots of room to tap out your beats. The arpeggiator allows for patterning of the rhythm and divisions of time, as well as a ‘Mutate Mode” that will generate variations automatically.</p>

<p>
    Novation's Mini was designed for use with Ableton Live, but it is not exclusive to it. You can play it with many other DAWs such as Logic and Reason. Several free plugins and a price tag of $110 make this a great deal not only for beginners but any on-the-go musician.

<h2 id="native-instruments-komplete-kontrol-m32">Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-native-instruments-komplete-kontrol-m32.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32" alt="Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol M32"></p>

<p>While A-Series by Native Instruments is not the best option for portability, this compact MIDI keyboard is one of the best you can buy with 32 keys. The Komplete Kontol M32 is USB 2.0 powered and although it contains mini-keys it certainly not locking any features.</p>

<p>The functionality is almost identical to the A-Series. Two touch strips control the pitch and modulation, four-directional push encoders, and eight touch-sensitive knobs will give you all of the control you need in your plugins and mixing in your DAW (and Komplet Kontrol's own software is included). Scale snapping, arp and chord triggering are enabled by Smart Play, and an LED display will keep you informed of what's going on.</p>

<p>The M32 is compatible with a range of DAWs, including Logic, GarageBand, and Ableton Live. The only real downside to this MIDI controller is its mini-keys, and the extra length needed to allow for 32 keys. But at $139 this is another excellent, portable choice to consider.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/QJu0WrQuCNE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="native-instruments-komplete-kontrol-a25">Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol A25</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-native-instruments-komplete-kontrol-a25.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol A25" alt="Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol A25"></p>

<p>The A-Series from Native Instruments is a much more affordable, albeit cut down, option when compared to their professional S-Series. But it is still a quality keyboard with tones of features and the same great Komplete Kontrol software.</p>

<p>Comping in 25, 49, and 61 key versions, the A-Series has a 4D joystick that will allow you to seamlessly navigate software. 8 knobs will control the parameters for your plugins, as well as modulation and pitch wheels, and several backlit buttons. An OLED display shows text-only feedback, and Smart Play is available.</p>

<p>The A-series can be paired with most DAW's, but it was designed to be paired with the included software from Kamplete Kontrol and Maschine, giving you access to NKS-enable plugins that will allow communication between instrument and effects and the keyboard itself. This allows plugin parameters to be mapped straight onto the knobs of the keyboard. Merely touch the knob and the OLED will display what its function mapping is.</p>

<p>Maschine's Element edition software is included with the A-series software bundle and it will allow note-input, transport, plugin-controls, and group and sound navigation, making for a much more reduced experience than that offered b the S-Series.</p>

<p>Overall this is a wonderfully built piece of studio hardware, and at $169 for the A-25 model, it is significantly more affordable than the equivalent from the S-Series.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/wwaZVP6B8zY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="arturia-keystep-midi-keyboard">Arturia KeyStep MIDI keyboard</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-arturia-keystep-midi-keyboard.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Arturia KeyStep MIDI keyboard" alt="Arturia KeyStep MIDI keyboard"></p>

<p>The KeyStep is packed with well-designed features and functionality. A range of input/output options are available, such as USB hookups, MIDI In/Out ports, as well as outputs for CV Pitch, Mod, and Gate. Additionally, there is a mini-jack In/Out port that works with a separately purchased pulse clock device. You will also have control over configuring the outputs further, like customizing the CV outputs to hertz per volt or volts per octave, and adjusting how the sync settings behave. One final connection is the input for a sustain pedal.</p>

<p>This is a beautifully designed piece of hardware. Lightweight, with slim (though not fully ‘mini) keys that are velocity-sensitive and fully playable. Conveniently place touch strips handle pitch and mod, and at under 50cm long, it is easily portable.</p>

<p>But there is more, and this is what really sets the KeyStep apart from its peers for a keyboard this size. A polyphonic sequencer comes built-in alongside the standard MIDI functions. An 8-pattern memory comes loaded with patterns that can be kept or overwritten by the user. Up to 64 steps can be recorded and can be added or removed from the end of the step-sequence.</p>

<p>The only real downside to this MIDI Keyboard is that, even though it comes with a host of CV and MIDI abilities, it does not ship with a power supply.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/1MzVMXNVnRo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2 id="korg-microkey-2-air-25">Korg MicroKey 2 Air 25</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-korg-microkey-2-air-25.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Korg MicroKey 2 Air 25" alt="Korg MicroKey 2 Air 25"></p>

<p>This Bluetooth-connected keyboard is the smallest of Korg's MircoKey family, which also hosts 37, 49, and 61 key models. Powered via AA batteries or USB. Containing a half-decent velocity=sensitive mini-keyboard, the MicroKey is incredibly compact and easy to use. A joystick, arp button, octave shift, and sustain/TAP buttons are the only controls, making it fairly minimally featured compared to some of the others on this list, especially when considering the $139 price-tag. But, if you're looking for a well-designed, minimalist wireless keyboard, you won't go wrong with this well-known brand.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/RnTrnNlqfjg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="novation-launchkey-37-mk3">Novation Launchkey 37 Mk3</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-novation-launchkey-37-mk3.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Novation Launchkey 37 Mk3" alt="Novation Launchkey 37 Mk3"></p>

<p>Launchkey's sleek design is what first stands out, but it's the features and its ability to take full advantage of Ableton Live that really sets this MIDI controller apart. With 37 keys, the Launchkey is small enough to still feel convenient but large enough to not feel as limited as a 25-key instrument.</p>

Featuring exceptional chord, scale, and arp modes that can be used both with a computer and as a<p>standalone function, the Launchkey 37 has a hardware MIDI out meaning you can also use it to control hardware synthesizers. 8 channel faders take their place on the top of the keyboard, and 16 backlit pads with velocity sensitivity (but no aftertouch) set beneath them. 8 rotaries as well as several browsing and transport control buttons round out the features.</p>

<p>The compatibility control with Ableton Live is simply astounding, allowing for easy navigation of many of the DAW's number of features. Novation's Launchkey also offered decent hands-on control with Logic Pro and custom MIDI mappings.</p>

<p>At $179 it's hard not to recommend this keyboard as a great mid-range option.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/MIiCKbBK6YA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="nektar-impact-lx88-midi-keyboard">Nektar Impact LX88+ MIDI keyboard</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-nektar-impact-lx88-midi-keyboard.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Nektar Impact LX88+ MIDI keyboard" alt="Nektar Impact LX88+ MIDI keyboard"></p>

<p>Nektar's full piano-sized, 88-note keyboard has just had a huge upgrade. With a semi-weighted, USB-powered keyboard you can expect expert-level control in your DAW with 9 sliders and buttons, 8 knobs and pads, as well as transport controls.</p>

<p>Dedicated mixer and instrument buttons allow for pre-mapping of controls and mixer settings (solo, pan, mute, level) as well as the parameters for virtual instruments (envelopes, filters). Individual pitch and modulation wheels are available, as well as up to two keyboard zones and layers are available via the layer and split buttons. Rounding off the features is a 5-pin MIDI output and foot pedal jack, as well as a 9-volt DC input. A LED red-digit display shows the controller values, giving it an old-school look.</p>

<p>A variety of DAWs are supported including Logic Pro X, Garageband, Digital Performer, Sonar, Reaper, Reason, Cubase, Bitwig Studio, and others. Though the LX88+ will not be everyone's choice (many will prefer a full weighted hammer action), but the price point ($319) and software bundles make this a strong option for those looking for a full-sized keyboard.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://youtube.com/embed/jV98xf3EVhU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<h2 id="novation-49-sl-mkiii">Novation 49 SL MKIII</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/439-novation-49-sl-mkiii.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Novation 49 SL MKIII" alt="Novation 49 SL MKIII"></p>

<p>This 49-key MIDI controller will give you the best of both worlds when it comes to software and hardware control. Yes, the SL will offer you full control over your DAW, but with its 8-channel sequencers and multiple outputs, this MIDI controller can do a lot on its own as well. This is certainly an expert-level piece of hardware, meaning you'll need to know what you are doing to get it set up to your particular studio setting. While it's not exactly plug-and-play, the flexibility win over experienced users.</p>

<p>With the SL MKIII, you will not only be able to sequence analog hardware but control it too as well as plugins and MIDI_equipped instruments. An adjustable velocity curve, pitch, and mod wheels, and a huge amount of buttons, rotaries, pads, and faders make this one of the most decked-out options on this list. 5 LCD screens will tell you everything that's going on.</p>

<p>SL MKIII is fully loaded with features, templates and is HUI-ready. A versatile workflow and infinite creative possibilities await its users, but its $700 price tag and its steep learning curve, this is definitely not for the uninitiated.</p>
