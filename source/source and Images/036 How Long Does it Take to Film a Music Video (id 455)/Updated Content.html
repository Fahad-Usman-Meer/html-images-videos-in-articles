<p>A great music video can greatly help you in promoting yourself or your band through social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and more. Contrary to what many might think, I music video doesn't actually cost a fortune. What's most important is that you need to have a good idea, a defined budget, and a good team around you.</p>
<p>Some production companies might charge a fortune for the simplest promotional videos but you need to back yourself because you can do it on your own. If you don't have enough time and resources, you could give the project to an up-and-coming producer or filmmaker.</p>
<p>While there is no definite answer to how long does it take to film a video because every music video is different, every scene, every take, every environment takes different times to set up the equipment, get the right lighting, and capture the perfect shot. Then, you need to spend some more time editing the video. The longer your music video, the more time it would take to edit.</p>
<p>While no one can tell you how long does it take to film a music video, but there are certain things you can do to make sure you utilize the time and don't end up taking longer than you should have. Before you start filming your music video, it is essential to plan out the video and take a few things into consideration.</p>

<p>While it may seem like the best idea would be to just start filming the video and see what you can come with it, but that might not make the most sense all the time.</p>
<p>Here are some factors that you should consider when choosing the song.</p>
<h3>Think ahead or try to recycle an old song</h3>
<p>It'll take much longer than you think to properly shoot, edit, and produce a music video. If your song is three minutes or longer, the 'new' single might already have come out by the time you publish your video.</p>

<p>Instead, you should consider selecting a song that has performed well in the past and use the single that is planned for release in the future, after you plan on publishing your next single.</p>

<h3>Don't always think in terms of a single</h3>
<p>In today's internet streaming world, any track can be a single. That is why you may pick a track from an upcoming album that you have a great music video idea for, even if the track wasn't originally planned to be a single.</p>

<h3>Consider starting small</h3>
<p>For every minute or two in a music video, it can easily take you and your crew anywhere from 2-10 hours of filming, editing, and finishing. The longer time it takes, the greater will be the risk of you abandoning the project.</p>

<h3>Make sure that your song inspires you</h3>
<p>You won't like every song that you produce. Music videos need to be the authentic expressions of the song's creator. Even the best filmmakers sometimes struggle to put together a video if the artist doesn't feel inspired by the lyrics or the sound of the song they've selected.</p>

<h3>If the song isn't yours, consider the copyright costs</h3>
<p>Don't just assume that a song that isn't yours is okay to use for your music video. If the budget permits, you can produce a video from a song produced by someone else that doesn't already have a video or single out on it. But you need to get the paperwork in place and move forward legally.</p>

<h2 id="casting-the-filming-crew-and-getting-equipment">Casting the filming crew and getting equipment</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/455-casting-the-filming-crew-and-getting-equipment.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Casting the filming crew and getting equipment" alt="Casting the filming crew and getting equipment"></p>

<p>Whether your shoot is simple or complicated, you will need a team to help you film the video. If you already have a team, everyone has to be clear on what they're responsible to accomplish.</p>
<p>Here are a few roles that you'll need to fill –</p>
<ul>
    <li>One or more camera persons</li>
    <li>A  lighting person for indoor shoots (if any)</li>
    <li>Actors based on the kind of videos you want to create</li>
    <li>Band members, if you are part of a band, you will need to get everyone on board with scheduling</li>
    <li>A director that everyone acknowledges is 'in charge'.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you build your filming team, you should consider their individual needs. If you're shooting through meal times, you should either provide food or remind your crew to bring food and set aside time for them to eat. If you're shooting the who day, you should keep a few hours to give the crew breaks.</p>
<p>Ideally, you need to be able to recruit a team that is capable of providing their own equipment. In case you've got the equipment yourself, you'll want to get the best that your allocated budget allows. Even though the features have significantly improved and prices have come down in recent years, purchasing a quality camera, gear, and lights can set you back a fortune.</p>
<p>As such, renting gear is often the best bet. Many people also use community arts program that allows them to rent equipment for relatively lower rates. You could even check out local colleges in your nearby area to see if someone would be willing to help.</p>
<p>You might end up finding film students who are willing to let you borrow their gear in exchange for a spot on your crew and gain valuable experience.</p>

<h2 id="plan-the-filming">Plan the filming</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/455-plan-the-filming.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Plan the filming" alt="Plan the filming"></p>

<p>Wasted time will cost you money as you're renting the location and equipment by the hour or day. Most film crews who waste time 'hanging out' instead of working simply end up spending a ton of extra money due to lack of planning. So take some time to think through how your music video will be filmed.</p>
<p>It is key to build storyboards for each shot. They'll ensure that you don't miss anything and you're able to describe to your crew exactly what you need. You should feel free to Google even the most obvious things like “music video storyboard template” if you want to find and download templates to work with. Sketch out each scene in the video and describe the scene underneath.</p>
<p>Once you've completed the storyboard, you should make a list of the equipment and casting you'll require for each shot. To make sure everyone is ready for their role, share the finished storyboard with the entire crew and discuss each shit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you need to make sure that the lighting and camera crew knows what the expectations are for each scene. You could even try improvising in the scene yourself. The people who are actually filming the video will be able to see what suits the video and make suggestions accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have hired a video director, you'll need to brief them on the storyboard first. The director will be able to handle the meetings, scheduling, discussions with the crew, etc. on their own.</p>

<h2 id="filming-the-music-video">Filming the music video</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/455-filming-the-music-video.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Filming the music video" alt="Filming the music video"></p>

<p>On the day of filming the video, you need to stay focused and stick to the plan. Be careful and keep a record of the shots you've made for editing. Always allow a lot of time for shooting. Even though the finished scene might only last 10 seconds, it can take many hours to set up and shoot.</p>
<p>With that said, avoid being so preoccupied with getting the perfect shot that you take five hours on one shot and have only five hours left to finish the remaining shots.</p>
<p>Ideally, you will need several good takes for each scene. In fact, you can never take too much footage, and the re-takes might capture something that you hadn't noticed in the previous shots. While it is never a good thing to deviate from the storyboard, your crew could do a few extra things for providing a nice touch to the available footage.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have multiple cameras, ask the 'idle' cameraman to keep shooting from other angles or in between scenes. This technique will get you golden footage that you didn't even realize was possible.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-live-footage">Capturing live footage</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/455-capturing-live-footage.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Capturing live footage" alt="Capturing live footage"></p>

<p>Filming yourself playing live would be a way to get some great footage for the music video. Filming yourself at a gig would mean you'll be able to capture the energy live and interac with the audience.</p>
<p>However, in case you're planning on shooting the entire video with live footage, you'll require professionals who are experienced with live filming because it can be quite a difficult thing to do properly.</p>
<p>A much better solution for someone who is filming their first music video will be to capture live footage and mix it with past footage.</p>
<p>Here are some of the unique challenges to consider when filming live for your music video –</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will have one shot at capturing the video, so you will not have many chances of capturing the right footage</li>
    <li>The live version might differ considerably from the recorded version, which means syncing the footage with the audio could be problematic</li>
    <li>Your movement and the audience's movement will not be choreographed. As such, you and the music video director cannot expect the audience to meet your expectations. However, their reactions will be genuine and if you're capturing genuine reactions, that will definitely turn into great footage.</li>
    <li>The lighting and effects might look good to the audience but might not look great on camera.</li>
    <li>Your filming could interrupt your performance. So make sure the crew is ready and the venue is large enough so that there is as little interference as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>One technique that will guarantee that your live footage perfectly syncs to the music video will be to 'stage' a live performance. You can play along to the track in front of an audience of selected fans. By doing the 'live' footage this way, you will be able to control the lighting and audience movement and get the track played as many times as you wish.</p>

<h2 id="use-stock-footage">Use stock footage</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/455-use-stock-footage.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Use stock footage" alt="Use stock footage"></p>

<p>You could spice up your music video by adding stock footage, but you should be aware that most video footages are subject to strict copyright laws. Making use of any footage without the permission of the copyright holder would be illegal.</p>
<p>However, there are some sources of footage that you could use legally. Royalty-free footage is the footage that you will be able to reuse in any setting without having to pay the copyright holder or without asking their permission each time you use them. However, you might have to pay a small fee to obtain the footage in the first place.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are many free stock, royalty-free websites that you can check out before paying for stock footage.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-right-video-editing-software">Use the right video editing software</h2>
<p><img src="/img-temp/455-use-the-right-video-editing-software.jpg" style="width:100%;" title="Use the right video editing software" alt="Use the right video editing software"></p>

<p>These days, you can get free software or relatively inexpensive software to do a decent job of video editing.</p>
<ul>
    <li>iMovie is the basic video editing software for Apple users</li>
    <li>Adobe's Premiere Elements will be a great option for PC users</li>
</ul>
<p>The professional use of different effects and editing tools will set your video apart. Most of it will depend on the capabilities of the video editing software that you use. For achieving the best quality look, you should consider using professional software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Apple Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Most computers and digital services are capable of editing film footage with ease. However, video editing will take up a lot of hard drive space, so you need to keep the hard drive clean and empty. You should get rid of any footage that you're not using (however be careful not to delete any footage that you'll be using). Invest in an external hard drive to get extra space to store the video footage.</p>
<p>The output format depends on its destination (where your video will end up eventually). Highly compressed formats are considered best for streaming over the internet (MP4 and Quicktime are among the most common). To send to the media/press, DVDs are still widely considered to be the best format while a DigiBeta tape might still be deemed essential for TV broadcasts.</p>
